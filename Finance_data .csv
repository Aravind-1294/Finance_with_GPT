"Mr. Barford and Mr. Manga, when both of you were younger and had much less capital for investing, how many, which publications were there for us to get the few excellent investment ideas to be so successful? And how many hours per week on average did you spend with reading about companies? ","Well, one way we're younger, we spent, probably surely compared to now spent a lot more time. I spend a fair amount more time looking at companies. But if we were doing it over again, we would do it over again pretty much the same way. We would look at everything inside that we thought we could understand. And the world hasn't changed in that respect. There may be some more people doing it, but there are a lot more companies to look at now. And we would read everything inside about the businesses and the industries we thought we could understand. We would look for things that jumped out at us as being very cheap in relation to value. And we would have one enormous advantage because we would be working with far less capital, which means the universal potential ideas would be far greater. But there's nothing different in my view about analyzing securities now than it was 50 years ago. Charlie? Yeah, we read a lot and we thought a lot. I don't know anybody who is wise who doesn't read a lot. And on the other hand, that alone won't do it. You have to have a temperament, really, which grabs the correct ideas and does something with those ideas. And I think most people who read a lot don't have the necessary temperament. And they grab the ideas, or they're simply confused by the massive material. And of course that won't work. There's probably something, Phil Kray used to talk about having a money mind. And I would call it a business mind. There are people that are better with identical IQs that are better adapted for one than the other. And the temperament is all important. I mean, if you can't control yourself no matter what the intellect you bring to the process, you're going to have disasters. And Charlie and I have seen one after another. It's not a business that requires extraordinary intellect. It does require extraordinary discipline. And that shouldn't be so difficult, but as I look around the world sometimes, it apparently is quite difficult. I mean, the whole world, one little mad a few years back in terms of investments. And say to yourself, how could that happen? Don't they learn anything from the earlier ones? But what we learn from history is that people don't learn from history. And you certainly see that in financial markets all the time. And so, you mentioned books. Charlie, you didn't recommend any books this year? Well, one book I really like. I couldn't buy because it's published only in England. But it'll get here and do course. And that's called Deep Simplicity by John Grieben. It's a perfectly marvelous book. And of course, that's a great title, Deep Simplicity. That's what we're all looking for. I've been reading a short history of nearly everything. And it's very impressive, too. You know, to read about people pondering how to figure out the weight of the earth or something in the 18th century. And you would think minds that could do that would do very well in financial matters. But, you know, if you remember, Isaac Newton spent a significant part of his life trying to turn lead into gold. And he might have made a good stock program. But it didn't do much for him financially. Charlie knows more about Isaac than I do. And he lost an enormous chunk of his net worth in the South Sea bubble. So he invested in an absolute crooked mania. And here was the smartest man in the world. So just IQ points alone won't do it."
"Recently there has been medication available to reduce cholesterol. My doctor even gave it to me since mine is kind of high. Every time I hear what you like to eat Warren, it makes me wonder what your cholesterol level is. Or if you even worry about it. I think everyone here wants you to be with us for a long time. So have you considered taking this new medication or you're at a cholesterol level?","Yeah, I do know the number. I don't remember. My doctor tells me it's a little high. But if he says it's a little high, I mean it isn't that high. He always tries to push me into making a few changes in my life. But I've got a wonderful doctor. And I was lucky last year because I hadn't been in the same for about five years. And due to, those guys cost a lot of money. I mean, and due to purely an accident, a reaction to some other medicine I was given when I was out of the city, he got a hold of me and then he shaved me into having a physical. And it was extremely lucky because I had a polyp in the column that would have probably caused trouble within a couple of years. I would say that if you asked my doctor, he would want me to make a few changes. But he would also say that my life expectancy is probably a lot better than the average person of 70. And I have no stress whatsoever, zero. I mean, I get to do what I love to do every day. And I'm surrounded by people that are terrific. So that problem in life just doesn't exist for me. And I don't smoke or drink or bubble end it right there. And so if you are an underwriter for a life company, you would make me consider we better than average. You'd be better than average too. And I'm sure that it could change it slightly, perhaps, on the probability of, if I change my diet dramatically or something, but it's very unlikely to happen. Actually, when my mother got to be 80, the most important thing in life in terms of how long you live is how long your parents live. So I got her an exercise bike when she got to be 80. She put 40,000 miles on it. I told her to watch her diet, do all these things. And I mean, she lived to be 92. So she did her share. And I helped her do it by giving her the exercise bicycle. So I think that improved my odds at that point, Charlie. Yeah. I have a book recommendation, which will be very helpful to all shareholders that worry about Warren's health and longevity. And that's this book called Genome by Matt Ridgley, who was for years the science editor of the Economist magazine. And if Ridgley is right, Warren has a very long life expectancy. They're very interesting correlations between people who cause stress to others instead of suffering it themselves. And Warren has been in that position ever since I've known him. And the figures that Ridgley quotes are awesomely interesting that it is a fabulous book. Of course, I'm recommending a best seller, but they're selling it in the airport. It's called Genome. And you'll feel very good about Warren's future if you agree with the science of the book. Don't worry."
"Ben Graham and the model of value investing, like bring discussion back to that. And what's interesting and exceptional about you and Charlie and Ben Graham is the self-discipline, the incredible self-discipline. And if you look at the model and try to think how to present it, to teach others that self-discipline, I think you have to make a little tweak to it in two areas. And that's what I'd like you to comment on. One, intrinsic value. It's always discussed that you calculate intrinsic value. But in practice, I think you find a number that is guaranteed 99% likely to be less than intrinsic value. Classic example was in 2000 when you said you'd buy shares back at 45,000. You weren't saying that Berkshire Hathways and intrinsic value was 45,000. You were saying it was significantly more. And anyone who boarded for less than 45,000 is grateful to you. The other area is the hidden assumption in the model. And that is, it's assumed that once you find a value stock and you buy it, that the intrinsic value isn't going to go down. And that's a second part of the analysis that has to be part of the discipline. So even though you found a value stock, you still haven't done all the work. You have to analyze, is the intrinsic value going to go down? In particular, companies throw away intrinsic value. It's the most common management. It gives it away. That hasn't happened at Berkshire Hathways. Although I don't want to give an unqualified comment on that since I see you remodeling the offices. So we don't know how much intrinsic value has been thrown away there. So if you comment on the two things, do you calculate intrinsic value or a number that's absolutely positively under intrinsic value? That's the number you put in equation. And even when you find a stock selling for less than this lower bound of intrinsic value, do you still do the homework on the second part and analyze, will the intrinsic value go down in the future?","Yeah, I would feel somewhat better qualified to speak on self-discipline if I weighed about 20 pounds less. For the moment, we'll ignore that. The second part of your question relating to intrinsic value going down. Actually, if you compute intrinsic value as reflecting the discounted value of future cash flows, that should have built into it a calculation that allows for the fact that certain businesses are going to earn less in the future than now. It isn't that their intrinsic value goes down then because you should build it into your calculation right now. But as we've pointed out many times in the past, intrinsic value is terribly important and very fuzzy. And we do our best to work with in the kind of businesses where we think that we have the highest probabilities where our predictions are fairly highly probable nature. And that leaves out all kinds of companies. It's pretty good. We'll say it's something like a natural gas pipeline. I mean, the chances of big surprises in a pipeline should be relatively small. That doesn't mean they're zero, but they're relatively small. Now, let's assume that you had a gas pipeline, which some may have, where either the supply of gas is going to run down or where there are competitive pipelines that may be trying to take away your contracts that you wrote 10 years ago and expire in two years and you're going to have to cut prices. I would say the two years from now when you have to cut prices, the intrinsic value hasn't gone down from today. If you properly calculated today and build in the fact that profit margins in the future will be lower than day. We looked at a pipeline recently where we think they are going to be vulnerable to competitive price pressures because of alternate ways of getting gas to market through other pipelines. And the calculation is entirely different. The calculations is different. The results are different. In terms of that pipeline versus the pipeline that is the low cost way of delivering gas from one market to another. And we'll remain the low cost producer. But it isn't. If properly calculated, you build in the prediction of decline in future operating areas. You don't wait till you get there to anticipate it. And Charlie's famous for saying that all he wants to know is where he's going to die so we'll never go there. Well, that's part of predicting in business. I mean, there. I love the. I really have never seen an investment banker's book. I hope to see once a day and I hope I can survive the shock when I do see it where the earnings of the business being offered go down. Lots of businesses earnings go down and they're going to go down. And I get all this nonsense, you know, where they project it out for 10 years and it always goes up. It just isn't the real world. And you have to analyze businesses. Some businesses are going to be subjected to enormous competitive pressures that aren't extent today. And we made that mistake, for example, at Dexter shoe. I mean, we bought a business that was earning $40 million or so pre tax. And we assumed that the future would be as good as the past. And we couldn't have been more. I couldn't have been more wrong. So that was a case of projecting into the future conditions, which we're not going to exist in the future competitive conditions. That's part of, you know, that's part of business. And I will tell you that, you know, 20% of the fortune 500, but I don't know which 20% are going to be earning, you know, significantly less money, probably five years from now than they are today. And that's, that's what the game is all about, figuring out what those future cash flows are likely to be. And when you can't, when you feel you can't come up with reasonable estimates in that respect, you move on to the next one. Charlie. Yeah, we have this simple old fashioned discipline, which weren't like instead dead Williams waiting for a fat pitch. I know about Warren, but if you said to me, Charlie, you can go into the business of managing money the way other people do. Or your measured against indexes and you got consultant choosing consultants that are reviewing you to committee. I would just hate it. I would regard it as being put into shackles and shackles where the very system was preventing me from delivering value. Warren, how would you feel about that? Yeah, we would show it. We wouldn't know. We never did do it as a matter of fact. And one of the initial when we formed the partnership on May 5th, 1956, I passed out to the seven limited partners or something called the ground rules. And I said, here's what I can do. And here's what I can't do. And there's some things I don't know whether I can do or not. Maybe it was fairly short. But the idea of setting out to do something that you know you can't do. That can't be, you know, that's got to lead to problems. I mean, somebody tells me I have to high jump seven feet. And we can even move that down to four feet now. You know, between now and sundown or I'll be shot. You know, I was gotten by a bulletproof vest. Yeah, the general system for money management requires people to pretend that they can do something that they can't do and to pretend to like it when they really don't. And I think that's a terrible way to spend your life, but it's very well paid. "
"My question to you is this, in your annual report this year, the letter to the shareholders, you indicated that it was 50 years ago that you met Benjamin Graham and that he had a major impact in your life, especially in your investment success. Moreover, you've stated in the past that the intelligent investors by far are the greatest book ever written on investing. One of the central tenants in the book was that if you bought a group of stocks, say 10 or 20, that traded at two thirds or less than net current assets, that you would be assured of a margin of safety coupled with a satisfactory rate of return. Today, if you were to find 10 or 20 stocks that traded at two thirds of net current assets, would you be inclined to purchase those stocks for your own personal portfolio, not for Berkshire Halfaway? In the second question, since I've mentioned the book, I was wondering which books that you and Mr. Munger have been reading lately and would recommend.","On respect to your first question, you could probably, if you found a group like that, and you won't, I don't think, you'd probably do all right buying the group, but not because the businesses themselves worked out that well over time, but because there would probably a reason a lot of corporate activity in a group like that, either in terms of the management taking them private or takeovers or that sort of thing. But those subworking capital stocks are just almost impossible to find now. And if you got into a market where a lot of them existed, you'd probably find wonderful businesses selling a lot cheaper too, and our inclination would be to go with a cheap, wonderful business. I don't think you'll get in a high market or something close to it. I don't think you'll get a lot of subworking capital stocks anymore. There's just too much money around to promote deals before they really get to that point. But that was a technique. It was 50 years ago. And there's water sloths here. Still, water, are you here stand up if you're here? I met water 50 years ago when I met Ben Graham. I know, I know, water came out this year, but he already knows everything I've been talking about. So he may have left. But water actually is practiced in securities much closer to the original. He's run a partnership now for 46 years, I guess it is. And he's done it much more with the type of stocks that Ben was talking about in those days. And he has a record that is absolutely sensational, but far better than people who who get promoted and go on television shows and do all of that sort of thing. And he's done it in, you know, what I tend to call cigar butt companies. You know, you get one free puff, and that's about it, but they don't cost anything. And that was the subworking capital type situations. Walters had to extend that somewhat, but it's been a great, great record over a considerable, I mean, 46 years, it can's very considerable period of time. So I think, if you found that kind of a group and did it as a group operation and Ben always emphasized a group operation because when you're dealing with lousy companies, but you expect a certain number to be taken over and all that, you better have a group of them, whereas if you deal with wonderful companies, you only need a couple. But I think, I think if you see that period again, we'll be very active, but it won't be in those kind of securities. You try. Yeah, and there's another change. In the old days, if the business stop working, you can take the working capital and stick it in the shareholders pockets. And nowadays, as you can tell from all of restructuring charges, when things really go to hell on a bucket, somebody else owns a lot of the working capital. The whole culture has changed. If you have a little business in France and you get tired of it, this Markson Spencer has, the French say, what the hell do you mean trying to take your capital back from France? They're French workers in this business. And they don't care, but they don't say, it's your working capital. Take it back when the business no longer works for you. They say, it's our working capital. The whole culture has changed on that one, not completely, but a lot from Ben Graham's day. There are a lot of reasons why the investment, what the idiosyncrasies of one era, don't translate that perfectly into another. That list was published. I figured whether it published in the 1951 edition of the security analysis of the 49 edition of the television investor, but there were a list of companies there with a sacco loll, those martial wells, those Cleveland Worcesters Mills, or Sposter Wheeler, and all those companies were subworking capital companies, selling it three or four times earnings. And there was, if you bought a group of stocks like that, you were going to do well. But you certainly don't see that in companies with any of any size today. And I've seen a few lists of tech companies selling below cash, but but they're determined to use that cash and they may not be there in a year or two. It was a different breed of animals, or some extent, and Ben's list at that time."
"Looking for some advice. You might give the young professionals here. I could be classified as one of those helpers you describe in your annual report. In fact, most of my friends are helpers and some could be classified as super helpers. Most would love to step out and explore some of their more innovative ideas, innovative business models, strategies and things of that nature. But the risk of giving up a significant salary, health insurance, flights, all the ridiculous corporate perks and some of us young professionals earn. What advice would you have enough into pursuing those dreams? Charlie, what do you think?","Well, there's certainly a lot more helpers in the economy than they're used to be. And the ones that come here tend to be the very best of the helper class. So I don't think you should judge the helper class by those you meet here. We get the best of them. And as to what the young helpers ought to do so that they'll eventually be like Warren Buffett, I would say the best thing you can do is reduce your expectations. I think I've heard that before. Well, as I wrote about and I trying to tweak system a little bit, but it is an interesting business in that the activities of the professionals are self-neutralizing and if your wife is going to have a baby, you're going to be better off if you call it an obstetrician probably than if you do it yourself. You know, and if you're plumbing pipes or clogged or something, you're probably better off calling a plumber. Most professions have value added to them above what the laymen can accomplish themselves. In aggregate, the investment profession does not do that. So you have a huge group of people making, I put the estimate is $140 billion a year that in aggregate are and can only accomplish what somebody can do in 10 minutes a year by themselves. And it's hard to think of another business like that. I can't think of anything. No, but it's become a bigger and bigger business. And as I pointed out in the report, the main thing that's been learned is that the more you charge, at least temporarily, the more money you bring in, the more you charge, the more you're prestigious. And people think that a business school that charges 50,000 years to it, that's useful to get into a business like that. Sometimes I'm talking to the people at a business school and I ask them what a great, to name me a great business. And of course, one of the great businesses is a business school that's got to be better than one charge, just 10,000 a year, if two a week. So there's some of that that, well, there's a lot of it that's gotten into the investment field recently and you now have large, certain large portions of the investment management that are charging fees that in aggregate cannot work out for investors. Now, obviously some do, you know, but you cannot be paying people 20% or they get it in the good years and they fold their partnerships and start another one if they have a bad year and that sort of thing. You can't have that coming out of an economy that's only going to produce, we'll say, you know, 7% or something like that a year for investors and have people net better off. It isn't going to work. And then the question that you will have is how do I pick out the few exceptions and everyone that calls upon you to sell you this will tell you that they are an exception. And I am willing to bet a significant sum of money it will put it up to anybody who wants to name 10 partnerships that are $500 million or more of management and pit those after fees against the S&P over a 10-year period. It gets away from the survivorship bias and all that kind of thing. And it isn't going to happen. But a few will do well. They're bound to do well. And actually, I think I do not have to pick a few that will do well. I did it in the past when I wound up my own partnership in 1969. I told people to go to either Bill Ruin or Sandy Gotisman and that would have been a very good decision, whichever place they went. So if you know enough about the person, know enough how they've done in the past, know enough about their personality and honesty and all of the things. I think that occasionally you can make a very intelligent choice in picking an investment manager. But I don't think you can do it if you're setting running a pension fund in some state and you have 50 people calling on you. You're going to go with the ones that are the best sales people and not the ones that are the best investors. Charlie. Yeah, on that state pension fund investment subject, I think it ought to be a crime to entertain in any way a state pension fund official. And I think it ought to be a crime. If you are a state pension fund, it will accept the entertainment. It's not a pretty scene in a lot of investment management. In America now. And human nature being what it is and the amounts of money being what they are, I don't think much is going to be improved."
"I know you like to buy into success stories, but you don't like to buy high tech. And it seems to me, say, in the case of Microsoft, that 10 years from now, they'll be doing software development just like 10 years from now, Coke will be selling sugar water. And what I'm wondering is why you feel that way when it seems certain companies, high tech companies are predictable. And it also seems that in the early 90s, you mentioned you were going to buy a pharmaceutical company, which also seems like high tech to me. So that's my question.","I think we said that with the pharmaceutical companies, we wouldn't have known how to pick out which one. We would have thought the industry as a group would do well. From those levels of 1993, you cannot buy high tech companies at anything like at levels that are commensurate with the levels of the pharmaceutical companies we're selling at at 93. And getting to the first part of your question, I think it's much easier to predict the relative strength that that Coke will enjoy in the soft drink world than the amount of strength that Microsoft will possess in the software world. That's not the knock Microsoft at all. If I had to bet on anybody, it certainly bet on Microsoft, bet heavily if I had to bet, but I don't have to bet. And I don't see that world as clearly as I see the soft drink world. Now somebody that has a lot of familiarity with software may very well see it that way. And they're entitled to, if it's true they have superior knowledge and they act on it, they're entitled to make money from that superior knowledge. There's nothing wrong with that. I know I don't have that kind of knowledge. I simply think, and I do think that it's, that you have a general knowledge of business over decades that you would regard the industry therein as less predictable than the soft drink industry. Now it may also be that even though it's less predictable that there's a whole lot more money to be made so that if you're right that the payoff is much larger. But we are perfectly willing to trade away a big payoff for a certain payoff and that's the way we're put together. It does not knock the ability of other people to make those decisions. I mean I asked, first time I met Bill Gates in 1991, I said if you're going to go away on a desert island for 10 years, you had to put your stock in two companies in the high tech business which would they be. And he named two very good stocks. And if I bought both of them, we'd have made a lot more money than we made even buying Coca-Cola. But he also would have said at the same time that if he went away, whether by Coca-Cola, because he would have felt sure about that happening. It's different people understand different businesses. And the important thing is to know which ones you do understand and when you're operating with them within what I call your circle of components. And the software business is not within my circle of components and I don't think it's within Charlie. Charlie. Well, I certainly agree with that. I think there are interesting questions too about how far the whole field can go. Take cheddar plane travel below the speed of sound. It's been pretty static in terms of the technology for a long, long time. You know, the big Boeing airliner is much the same as it was 20 or 30 years ago. And I think a lot of these businesses are quite dependent on the technology continuing to gallup and do more and more for people. Take pharmaceuticals. If they never invented any more pharmaceuticals, it would be a terrible business. I don't know what happens once you get unlimited bandwidth into the house and way more options. Beyond a certain point, it strikes me that there might be a surfeit of anybody's interest in the field. I don't know where that point is, whether it's 20 years out or 30 years out, but it would affect me a little. The Dilly bar is more certain to be here in 10 years than any software application that we know. But that's maybe because we understand Dilly bars and not software. In the whole United States, which is by far the most prosperous country in the world, the whole United States, there are probably around 400 companies, 400 total companies that are earning $200 million a year after tax. Of those 400, you can name them. I mean, you start, if you say bank, you can say city group and chase and Wells Fargo, and you can name them 10 or 15 of them. If you name consumer goods, you can say Procter and Gamble and Coca-Cola and Gillette. You can name them all much. You can almost, of those 400, you can probably name 350. If five years from now, instead of 400 being on that list, there'll probably be 450 on the list, maybe 475. A lot of those will be companies that are earning between $150 and $200 million now. So there'll probably be 20, some number like 20 that call it come from nowhere. If you look at the number of companies that are selling today at a price which implies $200 million or more of earnings right today, you will find dozens and dozens in the high tech arena. And, you know, a very large percentage of those companies are not going to fulfill people's expectations. I can't tell you which ones. But I know there won't be dozens and dozens and dozens of those companies making a couple of $100 million a year. And I know they are now selling at prices that require them to be making that much money or more. It just doesn't happen that often. You know, biotech was all the rage some years back. How many of those companies are making a couple of $100 million a year? Just doesn't happen. It's not that easy to make lots of money in the business and a capitalistic society. The people that are looking at what you're doing every day and trying to figure out a way to do it better and to, you know, under price you or bring out a better product or whatever it may be and a few companies make it. But here in the United States, after all of these decades and decades and decades of wonderful economic development, we've got about 400 companies that have hit the level that would be required of a company that would have a market cap of $3 billion. And some companies are getting $3 billion a market cap today. They come out first. There's some, we want to think about the math of all this."
"I've been an old and I'm from Minneapolis and first I just wanted to thank you for providing your past annual letters to the shareholders and Mr. Munger for providing your speech to the graduate students at USC a couple years ago. I'm drawing a lot of insights from that not only in investing but also in my day job as a business manager and I'm wondering if you could help me with my summer reading list and provide some additional suggestions for reading in the fields of investing and management other than the standards of Graham, Fisher, and so forth.","I have recently read a new book twice which I very seldom do and that book is Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond and it's a marvelous book and the way the guys mind works would be useful in business. He's got a mind that is always asking why, why, why, why, and he's very good at coming up with answers. I would say it's the best work of its kind I have ever read. I read a little easier book recently. I'm not even sure of the title. I don't pay much attention to titles when I get into the books but it's something to the effect of the court of a Einstein. I mean it's all, it's a lot of his commentary over the years and it's a great reading. The Firm Out Thereum was the book, that was an exact title either but it's the story of the discovery of the answer. I know that's a very interesting book. One of our shareholders from Sweden gave me a copy of that one. I was in New York and I've enjoyed it."
"In meeting Ajit Jain, I've been very impressed over the years. I think I even met his parents once, they came from India. Please comment on your deepest impressions of his personality and managerial skills and also how you go about exactly keeping somebody with such fine skills within the fold.","He might go to Walt Disney someday and pull down 200 million. Well, he gets offered 200 million. We may not have to compete too vigorously at that level. We basically try to run a business so that we surely have two jobs. We have to identify and keep good managers interested after we figured out who they are. And that often is a little different here because I would say a majority of our managers are financially independent so that they don't go to work because they are worried about putting kids through school or putting food on the table. So they have to have some reason to go to work aside from that. They have to be treated fairly in terms of compensation but they also have to figure it is better than playing golf every day or whatever it may be. So that's one of the jobs we have. We basically attack that the same way. We look at what they do the same way we look at what we do. We've got a wonderful group of shareholders before. I ran this ad a partnership. I had a great group of partners. I like to be left alone to do what I did. I like to be judged on the scorecard at the end of the year rather than on every stroke. And not second guest in a way that was inappropriate. I like to have people who understood the environment in which I was operating. So the important thing we do with managers generally is to find the 400 hitters and then not tell them how to swing as I put them in the report. The second thing we do is allocate capital. And aside from that we play bridge. Pretty much what happens at Berkshire. So with any of the managers you might name here, we try to make it interesting and fun for them to run their business. We try to have a compensation arrangement that's appropriate for the kind of business there. And we have no company-wide compensation plan. We wouldn't dream of having some compensation expert consultant come in and screw it up. We try to, some businesses require a lot of capital that we're in, some require no capital. Some are easy businesses where good profit margins are essential to come by. But we're really paying for the extra beyond that. Some are very tough businesses to make money. And it would be crazy to have some huge framework that we try to place everybody in that we're one size would fit all. People generally are compensated relating in some matter that relates to how their business does as opposed to, there's no reason to pay anybody based on how Berkshire does. Because no one has responsibility for Berkshire except for Charlie and me. And we try to make them responsible for their own units compensated based on how those units do. We try to understand the businesses they're in. So we know what the difference between a good performance and a bad performance. And that's about, that's how we work with people. We've had terrific luck over the years in retaining the managers that we wanted to retain. And it's, I think largely it's because particularly they sell us a business that to a great extent the next day they're running it just as they were the day before. And they're having as much fun running their businesses I have running Berkshire. Charlie? Well, I've got nothing to add but I think it's that concept of treating the other fellow. Although you'd like to be treated if the roles were reversed. It's so simple when you stop to think about it but it's a rare evening when I cheat and Warren aren't talking once on the phone. It's more than a business relationship at least seems that way to me. Yeah, well it is. And by the way, we like our business, our relationships to be more than a business relationship. Charlie and I are very far. We basically, it's a luxury but it's a luxury that we should try to nurture. We get to work with people we like. And it makes life a lot simpler. It probably helps on that goal of being the oldest living American too. Yeah, and we tend to like people we admire. Yeah, who do we like that we don't admire Charlie? Shark naming names. And these people have names."
"My question deals with price deflation. Could you please explain how technological advances and productivity increases are affecting our non-fixed income holdings, especially insurance?","Well I think that to the extent your question implies the question, how does technology affected the inflation rate, the advances in technology? I've heard Alan Greenspan make a lot of interesting comments on that. I think it baffles him to some extent but he also recognizes that there's some important very hard to measure factor that has caused inflation not to behave in the way that most people expected with this drop of employment, general prosperity, etc. And I think he attributes it in some part but again immeasurable to what has been happening in the information technology world. Obviously low inflation is good for fixed income investments but that's been reflected to a significant degree in a long-term rate that's at about 5.5% now. You know it does look at the moment like an almost perfect world in terms of the macroeconomic factors and probably as a reason why people are enthused about stocks and it's a good reason in terms of the price inflation. It's a good reason why bonds have behaved well over the last really since 1982. I don't know the answer to what it means for the future. I have to believe that it's very good for this country to have the lead in information technology that it does on the rest of the world. It seems to me as a non expert that we are so far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of having the leading companies and the money flowing into it, the brain power flowing into it that is hard to think of who's in second place and I think that's helped this country in some very significant way but I don't know how to measure it. Charlie? Well, I would say that Berkshire's business is on average, are left likely to be obsolete by no technology than businesses generally. You know steel-told work shoes. I do not anticipate a significant change in the technology. I think we have more of the stuff that's sort of basic and hard to obsolete than many other corporations do. As we mentioned in the report, we think all of that activity is very beneficial from a societal standpoint. Our own emphasis is on trying to find businesses that are predictable in a general way as to where they'll be in 10 or 15 or 20 years. That means we're looking for businesses that in general are not going to be susceptible to very much change. We view change as more of a threat into the investment process than an opportunity. That's quite contrary to the way most people are looking at equities now but we do not get enthused about, with a few exceptions, we do not get enthused about change as a way to make a lot of money. We try to look at, we're looking for the absence of change to protect ways that are already making a lot of money and allow them to make even more in the future. So we look at, we look at change as a threat and whenever we look at a business and we see lots of change coming nine times out of 10, we're going to pass on that and when we see something we think is very likely to look the same ten years from now, we feel much more confident about predicting it. Coca-Cola is still selling a product that is very, very similar to one that was sold 110 plus years ago and the fundamentals of distribution and talking to the consumer and all of that sort of thing. We haven't changed at all. Your analysis of Coca-Cola 50 years ago, pretty well-served in an analysis now, we're more comfortable in those kind of businesses. It means we miss a lot of very big winners but we would not affect those out anyway. It doesn't mean also that we have very few big losers and that's quite helpful over time. Yeah, the peanut brevils, that's very little technological change too. They better not change it. We like it just the way it is."
"Thanks to high energy prices, other factors Russia has been one of the best performing markets recently. The country's financial condition has stabilized since 1990s, a fledging middle class, taking shape as personal incomes grow, and there are also risks, political, legal, risk to minority investors. But there are also potentially great values among secondary companies there. I was wondering what needs to happen in Russia for you to invest there, whether for Berkshire or for yourself, and what kind of companies would interest you there?","That sounds like you may own a few Russian stocks yourself. I would, as you know, in 1998, what Walter Risenstein saw in the conference, don't default in 1998. In Russia at least he was proven wrong. And Charlie and I were inherited a business that saw a man that was in the oil business. Big time out in the Siberia. And there came a time when we got to dig the holes. We sent the money in. And as long as we were drilling, we were welcome. And then we wanted to start taking the oil out after our money had been used to drill the holes. They weren't quite as friendly. In fact, it was really kind of extreme what took place with us. So having had a few experiences like that, it might take us quite a while before we wanted to sink a lot of money into Russia. It may be different now, but I don't think it's any certainty. I had breakfast in Sun Valley three years ago. This July, I believe it was, with Kordakowski. And we had a translator there. And he talked to me about whether he was thinking about listing Yukos. I'm the New York Stock Exchange, but he said, you know, it would require registering with the FCC or something. And he wasn't sure whether that would, that was, be too dangerous. Well, I don't think he listed there, but he went back to Russian. He's been in jail now for, well, just about ever since. And Yukos was put into bankruptcy with tax claims. I don't, I just think it's a little hard to develop a lot of confidence that the world has changed permanently there in terms of its attitude toward capital and particularly toward outside capital. Charlie, what are your thoughts? Yeah, the situation reminds me a little of polypaterlium, which years ago was much traded in Los Angeles. And the saying always was, if they ever do find any oil, that old man will steal it. I'm afraid we have some of that problem in many of the countries in which we're seeking for oil. Well, didn't we really have the livelihood of our guys, threatened over there? Charlie one. I think we sent in some people to get out the equipment. And they said if they sent in the people to get out the equipment, not only would the equipment not get out, but the people wouldn't get out. So we understood the situation. That was not that long ago."
"I have a question about Gillette. Another significant Gillette investor, KKR, recently sold over a billion dollars in Gillette shares. Shares that they had acquired through Gillette's acquisition of Duraceau. Knowing that KKR has also been a successful investor, do you see this as a negative signal about Gillette's future prospects, particularly on the eve of the launch of the lock 3 razor? And what do you think their plans are for the remainder of their shares?","Well, I think they may have even publicly stated that I'm pretty sure they have. The Duraceau shares, from which the Gillette shares came were held by a specific investment fund that was formed in, I don't know what year, but a given year, and which is scheduled to dismantle at a certain point. So those shares, whether they were of Duraceau or whether they're of Gillette, were scheduled for disposition at some point within a given term. And I think that KKR made the decision and they made it with other stocks too, is to have that maybe three or so offerings between now and that terminal date for their partnership. And why they pick anyone of any given date is up to them and their advisors. It means nothing to us. If they didn't have that kind of a fund and they decided to sell it, it wouldn't make any difference to them. And I presume if we made a decision to sell it, it wouldn't make any difference in their case. We form our ideas of valuation independent of anybody else's thinking on it. But in the case of KKR specifically, they have a termination date on a partnership that own those shares and have to dispose of them one way or another between now and the termination date and probably decided that with the quantity of stock they had that they were going to have several sales. The mock three is terrific incidentally. I've been using it since October. Henry did not decide to sell it stock based on the mock three."
"Chairman, most company, Berkshire Invest at this time are not in high technology sector. What we have seen in the last few years, that there seems to be a significant growth both in sales and earnings of the high technology area. And also what you were shareholders believe that the times are changing from a brand name to high technology. My question is, can someone apply your investment principle, business philosophy and your discipline in life to build a portfolio of say five or six high technology company?","Let's call it Berkshire Hardaway Technology Fund. Well, I think it would sell. The question about Charlie and I won't be able to do it. Charlie probably understands high tech, but you can see how hard it is to get an information out of him. He hasn't told me yet. We try not to get into things that we don't understand. If we're going to lose your money, we want to be able to come before you next year and tell you we lost your money because we thought this and it turned out to be that. We don't want to say somebody wrote us a report saying this is what's going to happen in some field that we don't understand and therefore we lost your money by following someone else's advice. So we won't do it ourselves. I think that the principles, I think Ben Graham's principles are perfectly valid when applied to high tech companies. It's that we don't know how to do it, but that doesn't mean somebody else doesn't know how to do it. My guess is that if Bill Gates were thinking about some company in arena that he understood and that I didn't understand, he would apply much the same way of thinking about the investment decision that I would. He would just understand the business. I might think I understand Coca-Cola or Gillette and he may have the ability to understand a lot of other businesses that seem as clear to him as Coca-Cola, Gillette would seem to me. I think once he identified those, he would apply pretty much the same yardsticks in deciding how to act. I think he would have a margin of safety principle. It might be a little different because there's essentially more risk in a high tech company, but he would still have the margin of safety principle on a sort of adjusted for the mathematical risk of loss in his mind. He would look at it as a business, not as a stock. He would not buy it on borrowed money. I mean, a bunch of principles would be carried through, but our circle of things we understand is really unlikely to enlarge. It would be a tiny bit here or there, but if the capital doesn't get too large, the circle is okay. But we will not, if we have trouble finding things within our circle, we will not enlarge the circle. We'll wait. That's our approach."
"When you've identified a business that you consider to warrant further investigation, more intense investigation, how much time do you spend commonly? Both in terms of total hours and in terms of the span and weeks or months that you perform that investigation over.","Well the answer to that question is that now I spend practically none because I've done it in the past and one advantage of allocating capital is that an awful lot of what you do is it's cumulative in nature so that you do get continuing benefits out of things that you've done earlier. By now I'm probably fairly familiar with most of the businesses that might qualify for investment at Berkshire. But when I started out and for a long time I used to do a lot of what Philip Fisher described I followed this scuttlebutt method and I don't think you can do too much of it. Now the general premise of why you're interested in something should be 80% of it or there about. You don't want to be chasing down every idea that way so you should have a strong presumption you should be like a basketball coach who runs into a seven footer on the street. I mean you're interested to start with now you got to find out if you can keep them in school, if he's coordinated and all that sort of thing. That's the scuttlebutt aspect of it. But I believe that as you're acquiring knowledge about industries in general companies specifically that there really isn't anything like first doing some reading about them and then getting out and talking to competitors and customers and suppliers and ex-employees and current employees and whatever it may be. And you will learn a lot. But it should be the last 20% or 10% I mean you don't want to get too impressed by that because you really want to start with a business where you think the economics are good where they look like seven footers and then you want to go out with a scuttlebutt approach to possibly reject your original hypothesis or maybe if you confirm it maybe do it even more strongly. I did that with American Express back in the 60s and essentially the scuttlebutt approach so reinforced my feeling about it that I kept buying more and more and more as I went along. And if you talk to a bunch of people in an industry and you ask them what competitor they fear the most and why they fear them and all of that sort of thing, who would they use the silver bullet of Andy Groves on and so on. You're going to learn a lot about it. You'll probably know more about the industry than most of the people in it when you get through because you'll bring an independent perspective to it and you'll be listening to everything everyone says rather than coming in with these preconceived notions and just sort of listening to your own troops after a while. I advise it. I don't really do it much anymore. I do it a little bit and I talked in the annual report about how when we made the decision on keeping the American Express when we exchanged our perks for common stock in 1994. I was using the scuttlebutt approach when I talked to Frank Olson. I couldn't have talked to a better guy than Frank Olson. Frank Olson running Hertz Corporation, lots of experience at United Airlines and consumer marketing guide by nature. I mean he understands business and when I asked him how strong the American Express card was and what were the strengths and the weaknesses of it and who was coming along after it and so on. He could give me an answer in five minutes that would be better than I could accomplish in hours and hours and hours or weeks of roaming around and doing other things. You can learn from people and Frank was a user of it. I mean Frank was paying X percent to American Express for his Hertz cars and Frank doesn't like to pay out money so why was he paying that and if he was paying more than he was paying on master charge or visa why was he paying more and then what could he do about it. I mean you just keep asking questions and I guess Davey explained that in that video we had ahead of time. I was very grateful for doing that because that was a real effort for him but that was really what I was doing back in 1951 when I visited in Donah, Washington because I was trying to figure out why people would ensure with Dicol rather than with the companies that they were already ensuring with and how permanent that advantage was and what other things could you do with that advantage. There were just a lot of questions I wanted to ask him and he was terrific in giving me the answers. I changed my life in a major way so I got nobody to thank but Davey on it. But that's the scuttle about method and I do advise it."
"Hello Mr. Buffett Mr. Munger my name is William Schuhler and I'm a shareholder visiting from Spicewood, Texas I would like to thank you both for being so generous to the public with your ideas Last year I read poor Charlie's Almanac and came across a passage on share repurchases It reads quote When Berkshire has gotten cheap we found other even cheaper stocks to buy I'd always prefer this it's no fun to have the company So lacking in repute that we can make money for some shareholders by buying out others and quote last year You bought stock in some great businesses trading at fair prices such as Walmart and Budweiser But did not attempt to buy our own shares Would shareholders be correct to infer from this decision That you both felt Walmart and Budweiser","We're trading at a deeper discount to their intrinsic values than Berkshire was And would it be possible Debiased much Berkshire in the open market as you did Walmart without running up the share press Most of the time we would not be able to buy an amount that would be material in terms of Increasing the value of the remaining Berkshire shares, but that doesn't mean it would never happen But if you look at the trading volume on on Berkshire and Mark you might put that up if we can in a second We probably have less opportunity than most companies if our stock is so we should be selling below intrinsic value to have anything meaningful happen We would also have If we regarded some other company is worth X the good business and we could buy it at At 90% of X we might be doing that now whereas we wouldn't have done it many years ago But we might we might require a somewhat greater margin in terms of buying Berkshire shares simply because It our view on that might be less We probably have no more knowledge on it, but we might be less objective than on some other things we think that That when we buy if we were to buy in Berkshire shares and if you remember four or five years ago I announced we would if the price stayed the same That the case ought to really be compelling now. It's compelling. We ought to do it It was compelling at that time But simply the act of writing about it, you know, it's a little bit of a Heisenberg principle the act of writing about it In effect eliminated the opportunity to do it, which is fine because we do not We are not looking to make money off of buying from shareholders at a depressed price on the other hand at the price is sufficiently depressed We will announce again that We intend to do it and then we'll see whether we actually get a chance to do it Charlie Yeah, the whole climate in the country is different now It used to be that almost every company that bought in shares was buying the man at an obvious bargain price Now I think a lot of share buying is designed to sort of prop the stock price In other words, it's not bargain seeking. It's it's more like Sam Inzel Yeah, 40 years ago 30 years ago It was very it was a very fertile field For making money to look at companies that were aggressively buying in their shares that most extreme case probably being telegi But those people were buying Overwhelmingly Gordon Wallace was doing it at the companies he controlled those those people were motivated simply by the fact They wanted to buy the stock below but it was really worth and significantly below and you could make money with that group and we did a little of that at the time I would say in recent years That that motivation has been swamped by people who either think it's fashionable to buy in shares or Or buy people who really like the idea of trying to prop their stock up somewhat and the rule the SEC has certain rules in terms of your the way you conduct your repurchases to prevent Daily sort of propping up, but I think I think there's a lot of motivation that our stock is Got to be cheaper than other people's stock and we've got a wonderful company and so we're just going to buy the stock Come hell or high water and that is not the way we would go about repurchasing shares We've got What we had up there. I think Some figures that showed the turnover of Berkshire shares Compared in a year Compared with a few others I picked out. I think Berkshire has the lowest turnover by some margin of any major company than the in the United States And I put Walmart up there because the one The the the Walton family owns about the same in fact they own more of of Of Walmart than than I do with Berkshire. So this is not a function of simply the fact that we've got concentrated holdings With the Buffett family. This is a reflection of the fact that we've got A really unusual shareholder body And that they think of themselves as owners and not of people who are moving around with little pieces of paper every every week or month We we have the most in my view We have the most What I would call honestly got ownership Attitude Among our 400,000 or so shareholders of any company of any big traded company in the United States we people People buy Berkshire to own it and hold it and That's reflected in our turnover That doesn't mean if for some reason the stock gets cheap real cheap That we will not be able to buy a lot of stock in but we don't want we're not we're not looking to buy out our partners at a discount If it sells there and we tell them we're gonna buy it will buy it but but that's not That's not a way that we're trying to make money"
I just asked you if you could maybe comment on why you bought the original text,"If I could say what was the thing, someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked me, and said, for you not to forget to give the current year's recommended books. It's, I got to recommend the book on Charlie. But I'll let Charlie recommend one too. The original purchase of Berkshire was a terrible mistake and my mistake. No one, no one pushed me into it. It was, I bought it because it was what we used to call, or the cigar, it was a cigar about a approach to investing where we would look around for something with a free puff left in it, you know, was soggy and kind of disgusting and everything, but it was free. Berkshire was selling below working capital, had a history of repurchasing shares periodically on tender offers and it was selling it. First purchase was I think at seven and a half dollars a share and I got the brokers ticket up in the office, 2000 shares and they, it looked to me like they were going to have a tender offer periodically and there would probably be at some figure closer to working that working capital which might have been $11 or $12 shares on such number when we would sell on the tender. And that was, we had other securities we owned that way and we bought something that way. And then actually I met, see Barry Stanton one time, I was running Berkshire and he told me and made me an insider so I couldn't do anything but he said he was thinking of having a tender and he was wondering what price we'd tender at and I, as I remember, I maybe wrong and as I could look back on it but I think I said $11 and 3.8 and he said again to me, well if we have a tender $11 and 3.8 we would tender and I said yes I will. And then I was frozen out obviously of doing any stock for a little while but then he came along with the tender offer and as I remember I opened the envelope and it was $11.25 or maybe wrong as it may have been $11.5 and $11.3 but it was an eighth below what he had said to me and what I had agreed to. So I found that kind of irritating and I didn't tender and then I bought a lot of stock and I bought Kim Chase who's a director, his father had some members of the family, not his direct family but a related family that wanted to sell a block. And we bought several blocks and before long we controlled the company. So at an eighth of a point difference we wouldn't have bought it the company if they'd actually tendered at that price. We had a somewhat similar thing happen with Blue Chip actually later on too. Now we would have been much better off if we hadn't bought it because then things like national and demory and all of that instead of buying it into a public company with a great many other shareholders we would have bought it privately and the partnership in our partners would have had a greater interest. So Berkshire was exactly the wrong vehicle to use for buying a bunch of wonderful companies over time but I sort of stumbled into it and we kept moving along and when I just handed the partnership I distributed out the Berkshire because it seemed like the easiest and best thing to do and I followed through and I enjoyed it enormously. I'm glad it all worked out this way. It did not work out the best way economically in all probability. It was the wrong base to use to build an enterprise around but maybe in a way that's made it more fun. Charlie do you have anything to add on it? Tell them about the Blue Chip story. I know I have one such story as enough. But it is interesting that a wrong decision has been made to work out so well. We've done a lot of that. Scramble about it wrong decisions. I'd argue that's a big part of having a reasonable record in life. You can't avoid the wrong decisions but if you recognize them promptly and do something about them you can frequently turn them into lemonade which is what happened here. Warren twisted a lot of capital out of the textile business and invested it wisely and that's why we're all here. The Berkshire comes from three companies that came together, diversified retailing, Blue Chip's Namps and Berkshire. Diversified started when we bought a company called Hosel Cone in Baltimore in 1966 at the department store and that company disappeared over time. Fortunately in 1970 we sold it to supermarket general. Blue Chip we've told you about the record of that. We started out with three disasters and put them all together. This worked out pretty well but it was a mistake to be working from that kind of a base. Don't follow our example in that respect. Start out with a good business and then keep adding on to businesses. The example of quickly identifying the mistakes and taking action."
"By way of explaining, we wrote down the value of US air, reflecting our investment's current market value. You had a good explanation in your report as to why the economics of the business are unattractive. And I presume given the choice, we wouldn't do it over again. I think that's a first. I should mention anybody wanted to ask about US air, we put them in the other room just so you'll know why. Then the second part is better. But I watch you, I can see you at the monitor. And quoting from your profound statement, you don't have to make it back the way you lost it. Wouldn't it be a good idea to put that $89 million in something you wrote?","I really behind as opposed to US air. Well, that's a very good question because it is true that very important principle and investing is you don't have to make it back the way you lost it. And in fact, it's usually a mistake to try and make it back the way you lost it. And when we write our investment down as we did with US air, $89 million, we probably think it's worth something more than that. But we tend to want to be on the conservative side, but it's worth a whole lot less than we paid. And the nature of that preferred as well as other private issues we bought usually makes it quite difficult to sell. That's one of the things we know going in. When we bought preferred, some people thought that we were getting unusually favorable terms. I haven't heard from them lately on US air. But one of the considerations in that is that if you buy 100 shares of a preferred that's being offered through a securities firm from the same issue, you can sell it tomorrow. And we are restricted in some ways legally and in other ways simply by the way that markets work from disposing of holdings like that. And we know that there's an extra cost involved to us if we should try to sell or it may be impossible. And that's not a great importance with us because we don't buy things to sell, but it's of some importance. And we are not in the same position owning our series A preferred of US air as we would be if we bought 1,000 shares or 5,000 shares of the series B preferred, I believe it is, the trades on the New York Stock Exchange. That would be very saleable. And our preferred could well even be saleable at a price modestly above what we carry it for, but it would require, it would not be very easy to do. If it were to do it, we could probably, assuming we could do it at all, we could probably get a little more money for it. But it would not be easy to do. Partly because of the legal restrictions, Charlie and I are on the board that complicates things. You always know something just by being on the board that the public doesn't know, so that complicates things. In the end, we usually find that dealing with anything where we've got fiduciary obligations is maybe not practical at all. Charlie? It's probably more talking on it to work. Charlie? Yeah. Well, it's certainly been an interesting experience, the US air experience. Is that it, Charlie? No, I'd like to repeat that business about not having to get it back the way you lost it. That's the reason so many people are ruined by gambling. They get behind and then they feel they have to get it back the way they lost it. It's a deep part of the human nature. And it's very smart just to lick it by will and little phrases like that are very useful. One of the important things in stocks is that the stock does not know that you own it. You have all these feelings about it. You remember what you paid and all that. Remember who told you about it? All these little things. It doesn't give a damn. It just sits there. You know, you stock at 50. Somebody's paid 100. They feel terrible. Somebody else paid 10. They feel wonderful. All these feelings. And it has no impact whatsoever. So it's as Charlie says gambling is the classic example. Someone builds a business over years. That they know how to do. And then they go out someplace and get into a mathematically disadvantageous game. Start losing it and they think they have to make it back not only the way they lost it but that night. And it's a great mistake."
I have a question for you Mr. Buffett What do you think about managed futures funds?,"I didn't quite get that what kind of fund managed futures funds like a very well-desertified portfolio in stocks and bonds going long and short all the different markets based on the most natural human behavior of a trend following or hurt behavior managed futures funds Well, I would say that we think the most logical fund is the one we have at Berkshire where essentially we can do anything that makes sense and are not compelled to do anything that we don't think makes sense So any any any entity that is devoted to a limited segment of the financial market we would regard as being at a disadvantage to one that has total authority if you have the right person in charge, but you that's an assumption you're going to make under any fund So we would not want to devote our funds to something that was only going to buy bonds something was only going to buy futures or anything of the sort we would we would we buy futures at Berkshire we buy bonds at Berkshire we bought we buy currencies we buy businesses so I think it's I think it's a mistake to shrink the universe of possibilities ours is shrunk simply by size, but we don't try to we don't set out to circumscribe our actions in any way But in the end there's no form that produces investment results hedge funds don't produce investment results private equity doesn't produce investment results mutual funds don't produce it that If it was simply a matter of form we'd all call ourselves You know, whatever that form happened to be what really makes the difference is whether the person that's running it knows what their limitations are knows where their strengths are plays when they have the opportunity to play advantageously and stays out When they don't see any opportunities Charlie Yeah, I'd go further. I'd say averaged out I Would expect that the return per dollar per year in managed futures funds would be somewhere between Lousey and negative And I would agree with that. Yeah Yeah Usually those are sales tools. I mean people find out something that will sell and it can be you know It can be bond funds at some point it can be in the but when they find something to sell it'll it'll get sold to the public that will be it will sell till it stops selling and That means lots of money comes in and lots of competition for a limited number of opportunities and I Think it's I think it's a mistake to get sold something on the on the basis that here is a great area of opportunity Opportunity areas don't make opportunities brains make opportunities"
"In the mistake is your section of the annual report, you mentioned a fundamental rule of economics that you missed. I'd like to know the two or three most important fundamental rules of economics you habitually get right. In other words, what are the fundamental rules of economics you used to make money for Berkshire? And I'm not talking about Ben Graham's principles here, but rather rules of economics which may be found in an economics textbook.","Yeah, we try to, I mean, we try to follow Ben's principles in terms of the attitude we bring toward both investing and then buying businesses. But the most important thing you can, you know, what we're trying to do is we're trying to find a business with a wide and long lasting mode around it, and protecting a terrific economic castle with an honest lord in charge of the castle. And in essence, that's what business is all about. I mean, you may want to be the lord of the castle yourself in which case you don't worry about that last factor. What you're trying to, what we're trying to find is a business for one reason or another. It can be, it can be because it's the low cost producer in some area. It can be because it has an actual franchise because it's a service capable of it can be because of its position in the consumer's mind. It can be because of a technological advantage. Any kind of reason at all that it has this mode around it. And then our, then what we have to decide is, is all modes are subject to attack in a capitalistic system. So everybody is going to try, if you got a big castle in there, people are going to be trying to figure out how to get to it. And what we have to decide, and most, most modes aren't worth a damn in capitalism. I mean, that's the nature of it. And it's a constructive thing that that's the case. But we are trying to figure out what is keeping, why is that castle still standing? And what's going to keep it standing or cause it not to be standing five, 10, 20 years from now? And how permanent are they? How much do they depend on the genius of the Lord in the castle? And then if we feel good about the moat, then we try to figure out whether the Lord is going to try and take it off for himself or whether he's likely to do something stupid with the proceeds, et cetera. But that's the way we look at businesses. Charlie, you want anything? Well, I think he wants to translate it into the ordinary terms of economics. The honest Lord is low agency costs. That's the word in economics. And the microeconomic business advantages are, by and large advantages of scale, scale of market dominance, which can be a retailer that just has huge advantages in terms of buying cheaper and enjoying higher sales per square foot. So by and large, you're talking economies of scale. You can have scale of intelligence. In other words, you can have a Lord with enough extra intelligence that he has a big advantage. So by and large, you're talking scale advantages and low agency costs. And some extent, Charlie and I are trying to distinguish between businesses where you have to be smart once and businesses where you have to stay smart. And I mean, retailing is a good case of a business where you have to stay smart. You are under attack all the time. People are in your store. If you're doing something successful there in your store the next day, trying to figure out what it is about your success that they can transplant and maybe adds a little something on in their own situation. So you cannot coast in retailing. There are other businesses where you only have to be smart once, at least for a very long time. There was once a Southern publisher who was doing very well with his newspaper and someone asked him the secret of his success and he said monopoly and nepotism. And I mean, he wasn't so dumb. I mean, he didn't have any illusions about himself. And if you had a big network of television affiliates station 30 years ago, there's still a major difference between good management and bad management. I mean, a major difference. But you could be a terrible manager and make a fortune, basically, because the one decision to own the network TV affiliate overcame almost any deficiency that existed from that point forward. And that would not be true if you were the first one to come up with some concept in retailing or something of the sort. I mean, you would have to be out there defending it every day. Ideally, you want terrific management at a terrific business. And that's what we look for. But as we pointed out in the past, if you have to choose between the two, get a terrific business."
"In order for Berkshire to have an opportunity to hopefully grow its earnings by about 15% per year, if we can do that, at least for the next few years, it's obvious that because of the redeployment of earnings and flow, the existing businesses do not need to grow at 15%. What rate would you expect the existing businesses to grow to achieve an aggregate rate close to what I'm describing and what do you think the probability is of achieving that?","Well, I think the probability of us achieving 15% growth in earnings over a extended period of years is so close to zero, it's not worth calculating. We'll do our best and we have a lot of fun doing it. It's not something where we have to come down and do things that are boring to us or anything of the sort. Our inclination is very much to do everything we can legitimately to add to Berkshire's earnings and things we can understand. But it can't happen over time. We will have years when we do it. We are quite correct in pointing out we don't need to do it from the present businesses. We will add things all the time. Any more that we need to do it from the current business back in 1965 with the textile business. We have to improvise as we go along and we will. The businesses we have are good businesses in aggregate. They will do well. They won't do anything like 15% growth per year. But we will take a good rate of progress from those businesses and we will superimpose upon that acquisitions which will add to that. We can't do 15 over a period of time. Nor incidentally do we think any large company in the United States is likely to do. There will be a couple that do it for a long period of time. To predict which of the Fortune 500 will end up being the one or two or three would be very hard to do. It won't be more than a couple out of 500. If you take large companies not working from a deflated base year, I think our method is a pretty good one. I think the idea of having a group of good businesses that throw off cash in aggregate in a big way, let themselves grow that are run by terrific people. And then adding on to those sometimes the slow rate but every now and then are a good clip. More businesses are the same kind and not increasing the outstanding shares. I think that's about as good a business model as you can have for a company our size. What it produces will have to see. Charlie. I certainly agree that the chances of this 15% per annum progress extrapolated way forward is virtually impossible. I think generally the Sherylding class in America should reduce its expectations a lot. Including the pension funds. Including the pension funds you bet. It's stupid the way people are extrapolating the past. This is not slightly stupid, but massively stupid. And this is a message incidentally if you think about it. Nobody has any interest in saying this, financial interest in saying it. Whereas people have all kinds of financial interest in saying just the opposite. So you do not get an information flow. If you listen to the financial world or read the financial press, you do not get an information flow that is balanced in any way in terms of looking at the problem. Because the money is in believing something different. And money is what causes people to become prominent or close from becoming prominent in the investment world in terms of whether you go on television shows or whether you manage money or trying to attract it through funds or whatever it may be. I don't think if you were an actual consultant and you insisted that your company, the company is that you gave your actual report to use a 6% investment rate. I don't think you'd have a client. So it's almost impossible for the advisors in effect in my view to be intellectually honest on it. Do you think so, Tron? Yeah, there was a very smart investment advisor in my town. He said that years ago some risk arbitrage firm would tell us clients, we know how to make 15% for Adam, year in and year out. And he said years ago, everybody said that's impossible. He says now in this climate, they say so what? Who's ever sitting in the Lausy 15%? And it was easier in the earlier climate, obviously, because the money hadn't been attracted into it. Generally speaking, there's more publicity to be gained by reducing expectations than in any other way. It is simply crazy for this group to have very high expectations. Moderate expectations will do fine for all of us. Okay, we'll take one more before we break for lunch. We'll go to number two."
"in the current environment, it seems that the attacks on the modes of wonderful businesses are coming from inside the castle in the form of option-based compensation just as much as from outside competitors. One of your role models Ben Franklin said even a small hole can sing a great ship. It seems like the holes are getting bigger. Can you discuss what if any forces may cause this to change? Is it a problem that will get worse or get better? My second is specifically in your role as directors of companies like Coke and Gillette. Are you seeking to change these practices? What kind of success do you expect there to the Electro and the Com Committee? And three, if these compensation practices are irrational, does Berkshire benefit from this irrationality?","Well, to carry the castle analogy further, we now look for a great economic castle, but we look for a great night in charge of that castle because that's important. He's the one that throws the crocodiles into the mouth and widens the mode over time. And of course, the question is, you know, how much does the night get of the castle for doing that? And I think generally speaking at Berkshire, you get a very fair deal in terms of the amount that we've got a lot of castles around and we try to pay people fairly, but what I don't think that the division is unfair between the owners of the castle and the knights that are around there protecting the mode. It's hard for me to imagine how the compensation practices, the question of how much the night gets of the castle, how that changes in favor of the owners of the castle over time. The ratcheting effect is just unbelievable. No one, no compensation committee in America will have a, be listening to a consultant who walks in and says, I think your management is, you know, should have an arrangement that ends up in them being in the lower half. And if no one wants to be in the lower half, believe me, the median is going to move up. I mean, there is no way around that. I mean, these people meet yearly or more often. And they sit there with a proxy statement of every other company in their business. You know, and they pick out the ones that have the biggest numbers in them. And they say, well, gee, we need a management at least as good as this and how are we going to track people and all this other stuff. And it can only go, it'll only ratchet upward. And I think that's a fact of life. And I think that it's important for shareholders to understand that. I've been on the board of 19 companies, not counting any Berkshire subsidiaries or anything like that. I was on the last comp committee I was on was at Solomon. And I was chairman of the comp committee, I think. I may be wrong on that. There were three of us. And the other two guys were terrific guys. And the earnings came in one year, $100 million or so. I think it was 1990 below the previous year. And comp was up a fair amount. And I'd find that there'd been some earlier issues involved. So I just said I couldn't swallow anymore. And I voted against it. I can't remember what I was chairman or not. But in any event, it was two to one against me. And I think it would have been two to one against me if I'd been chairman. And the other two fellows were perfectly rational. So how do we keep these people? And you know, how can we repudiate our management? All the sort of things you get. So as a practical, I've got one friend terribly well regarded businessman. And he's been, they don't throw you off the comp committee. They just don't re-nominate you. And he's been, he's been bounced from two of them simply by raising some questions that about things you would find outrageous. I'm not on the comp committee. I've been on only one comp committee. And they saw what I did. So that was the end of it. People say, you know, we love your ideas. And you know, you think creatively. We don't want to hear about your thoughts on your conversation. And that, you know, it's understandable. You know, and you run into some terrific cases of people. I mean, the fellow runs fast and all, for example, I mean, they just, you know, outstanding. And they're, they're a number of cases where people behave very well. But most of them, I think some, I don't think it's money so much. Sometimes I just think it's ego. They just can't stand to see some guy that they think is batting in 280 and they're batting 300 and he's getting paid more money. And, you know, and that process is endless. And that, you know, that's understandable. It's like who gets top billing in a movie or something of a sort. People care about the, you know, where their name is compared to somebody else's. And their name in this case is compensation. And it, it, I doubt if it reverses itself, Charlie. So I think we can confidently expect that the situation will get worse. And I think we can confidently expect that that is bad for Berbercher, out of the way, to the extent that it's a passive shareholder and, and, and big corporations. There is one place where we get an advantage. Our own culture and attitude of being so different. It does attract some of these people that own wonderful businesses. I mean, we literally on occasion find people for whom we're the only acceptable buyer. They don't like this culture of other big corporations any better than you do. And, and that does give us an advantage. Yeah, you asked us a question also about the how active we might be in, and saying these, we're not going to ever sit here and tell you what we say in other boardrooms because it would, it would reduce any effectiveness we might have. And we probably don't have that much effectiveness anyway. But, you know, you can only belt so many times at the dinner table and get invited back. And, and, and we, we've probably done enough of our share of that. And then you, we try to run Berbercher in a way that we find admirable. And we try to spell out our reasoning on it and everything else. And we hope that maybe somebody latches onto that as, as a model someplace. But going around condemning people by name does not work. And so we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we hate to sit in, love to sit in all that sort of thing. And, it doesn't have much effect."
"I'm sort of representing Benjamin Graham today. The question he might ask. You talked earlier about the value of your shares. The case shares, let's say, because the B is tied to the A. And I don't expect a complete answer. But generally, how would you go about placing a value on the A shares?","Well, that's obviously a key question. As I've said, we try to give you the information. But I think people, to the extent they've made a mistake in the past in valuing Berkshire. And they have made this mistake over time, including many commentators, including some institutions, is to look at it as simply a breakup value to our businesses. I mean, you could do the same thing with General Electric, magnificently run operation by Jack Welch. But I don't think the way you should look at a business like General Electric is to think about what would happen if they sold each division today, paid the taxes, and then distributed the proceeds. And that is tended to be the case with many people looking at Berkshire, looking at it on a static basis. And that is not the way that Charlie and I have looked at it over time. It lends itself a little more of that kind of analysis because we have a lot of money in marketable securities. But we have a lot of money and other things, too. And the question of Berkshire, in valuing the intrinsic value of any business, of course, is what is going to be the stream of cash over many years in the future. In fact, all of the years in the future, discounted back an appropriate interest rate. I've talked about that in the past and the annual report. Berkshire is a collection of businesses, and some of which we own in their entirety, some of which we own part of. And some of those businesses have very interesting dynamics to them. And the value of our insurance business, for example, if you go back 26, what was it, 28 years or so since we, 29, I guess, since we bought it from Jack Ringwall, we paid 8.7 million, I believe, 8.48, 8.7 million for two companies that Jack controlled. If you had the foresight at that time, and I didn't, but if you had the foresight at that time to see what that would develop out of that insurance business, you would have come to the conclusion that their value to us was going to be far, far greater than the value at which they were then carried on our balance sheet. They were part of a business which had enormous potential. And that's been probably the most significant asset that's been developed at Berkshire. But right now, we have over 7 billion, right at 7 billion, over 7 billion, a float that's been developed from our insurance business. We couldn't foresee that 25 or 30 years ago, but it would have been a big mistake to think in terms of the book value of that business being representative of his actual value to us over time if it was run right. And that situation probably prevails today. So it's a, Berkshire is a group of unbalanced, very fine businesses to which we hope to add. The intrinsic value will be affected by the job we do in allocating capital. It'll be affected by the job our managers do in running their businesses. It'll be affected by some items that we don't foresee now. And perhaps have no control over. But it is not measured essentially by what we could sell each separate business for and pay the tax on now. We haven't run it that way. We've run it so that we get the use of a lot of capital at very low cost between deferred taxes. And our insurance float, we have some 12 billion or so on the liability side that we think will be a very low cost. And that doesn't show as an asset. But it can be quite valuable. Charlie, you want to? No, I don't think I've got anything to add to that. I was all set to write it down too."
"My question is, what are your thoughts about the residential real estate market in the US, where it's headed, and how is California different if so?","Well, Charlie's our California expert. We've managed one time to develop a great piece of property in California. We spent about 20 years or so developing in Charlene. Yes, and we got our money back with interest. Barely. Barely. Yeah. We finished it at just the wrong time. The land value that we nurtured, that was a terrific piece of land. Charlie lives there. I don't think it's an exaggeration. Some say we spent 20 years talking and developing the land. And the land value which in effect we cashed out for what, $5 or $60 million now would have the implicit land value with being what? Maybe $100 million. But we finished it at the wrong time. It's a wonderful, climate is wonderful. Everything's wonderful about this property. It's just that from time to time, even in great localities, you've seen it happen in New York a couple of times in the last 30 years where the swing in properties and values have just been huge. And what we see in our residential brokerage business, and we're in, I don't know how many different states, is we see a slow down every place. Now, we see it most dramatically in some of what have been the hottest markets. And the markets where you're going to, in my view, you're likely to see the greatest fall off and where you've had the biggest bubble or the ones tend to be the high end market and they tend to be ones where people have bought for investment or speculation rather than use. They don't know a place for you. They're $1,000 for a house and mortgage it for $270,000. And if the value goes to $250 if they have a job and everything, they won't move out. I mean, that you don't lose a lot of money even though the market value on a given day is less than the loan value when families say together an employment is present and all that. But when you have investment type holdings or speculation type holdings, when you in effect have had the day traders, you know, of the internet move into the day trading of condos, then you get a transaction, then you get a market that can move in a big way. First it sort of stops and then it kind of reopens. Real estate is different than stocks. If you own 100 shares of general motors, it's going to trade on Monday and that's what it's worth and you can't kid yourself about it. But if you own real estate, you know, there's a great tendency to think about the one that sold down the street a few months ago and there's a great tendency to think, you know, you only need one buyer who hasn't gotten the word that things have slowed down and you'll make your sale. I can tell you that in date and Broward County, for example, in Florida where the average condo is about 500,000, if you go back to December of 2004, there were less than 9,000 condos listed for sale and I think 2,900 of them sold in the month. So you were turnover one every three months less than that. Now the listings are up to 30,000 and the sales are down to under 2,000 a month. Well 30,000 is 15 billion dollars worth of properties and you were very likely, you can get real discontinuities in a market like that where all of a sudden people realize that the whole supply-to-man situation has changed. So I think we've had above all of the some degree and it's very hard to measure that degree to them until after it's all over but I would be surprised if there aren't some significant downward adjustments from the peak, particularly in the higher end properties. Yeah, and the man is right that the bubbles came and Manhattan and certain places in California in Omaha, housing prices are quite reasonable. So the country is not all the same at all. We just got an estimate of the 10th to 24,000 which was about what it looked like from the ticket suite. I thank you all for coming on that. Even better, the furniture mart which had sales in 1997, the five and a fraction million, the two thousand three sales of 17 million, sales last year, 27 million is up so far two and a half million with the best yet to come. So I would say we're likely to do over 30 million at the furniture mart and that incidentally is about equal to a normal monthly volume for the stars. So you're doing your part."
My question has to do with what you mentioned earlier about how companies have to reinvest a certain amount of cash in their business every year just to stay in place. And if one could say that the best businesses are the ones that not only throw off lots of cash but can reinvest it in more capacity. But I suppose the paradox is that the better companies opportunities for making expansionary capital expenditures the worse they appear to be as consumers of cash rather than generators of cash. What specific techniques have you used to figure out the maintenance capital expenditures that you need to do in order to figure out how much cash a company is throwing on? What techniques have you used on Gillette or other companies that you've studied?,"If you look at a company such as Gillette or Coke you won't find great differences between their depreciation. Forget about amortization for them all. But depreciation and sort of the required capital expenditures. If we got into a hyperinflationary period or I mean you can find you can set up cases where that wouldn't be true. But by and large the depreciation charge is not inappropriate in most companies to use as a proxy for required capital expenditures which is why we think that reported earnings plus amortization of intangibles usually gives a pretty good indication of earning power. I've never given a thought to whether Gillette needs to spend $100 million more, $100 million less than depreciation in order to maintain its competitive position. But I would guess the range is even considerably less than that versus its recorded depreciation. Businesses you have to worry about. I mean an airline business is a good case and in the airlines you just have to keep spending money like crazy and you have to spend money like crazy if it's a track you have to spend money and you have to spend the same way if it's unattractive. It's part of the game. Even in our tech style business to stay competitive we would have needed to spend substantial money without any clear prospects of making any money when we got through spending it. And those are real traps those kind of businesses and they may work out one way or another but they're dangerous. In a seize candy we would love to be able to spend $10 million, $100 million, $500 million and get anything like the returns we've gotten in the past. But there aren't good ways to do it unfortunately. We'll keep looking. But it's not a business where capital produces the profits. It's a flight safety capital produces the profits. You need more simulators as you go along and more pilots are to be trained and so capital is required to produce profits but it's just not the case it sees. And Coca-Cola, particularly when new markets come along, the China's of the world or East Germany or something of the sort, the Coca-Cola company itself would frequently make the investments needed to build up the bottling infrastructure to rapidly capitalize on those markets, the old Soviet Union. So those are expenditure. You don't even make the calculation on them. You just know you've got to do it. You've got a wonderful business and you want to have it spread worldwide and you want to capitalize on it to its fullest. And you can make a return on investment calculation. But as far as I'm concerned it's a waste of time because you're going to do it anyway. And you know you want to dominate those markets over time. And eventually you'll probably fold those investments into other bottling systems as the market gets developed. You've got to wait for conventional bombers to do it. You want to be there. One of the ironies incidentally, you might get a kick out of some of the older members of the audience that when the Berlin Wall went down and Coke was there that day with Coca-Cola for East Germany, that Coke came from the bottling plant at Dunkirk. So there was a certain poetic ironie there. Charlie, do you have any hand? I've heard we're in the same sense very early in his life that the difference between good business and a bad business is usually that good business just throws up one easy decision after another. Whereas the bad business gives you a horrible choice where the decision is hard to make. Is this really going to work? If you want a system for determining which is a good business and which is a bad business, to see which one is throwing the management bloopers time after time after time. Easy decisions. It's not very hard for us to open a new seas store and a new shopping center in California that's obviously going to succeed. It's a blooper. On the other hand, there are plenty of businesses where the decisions that come across you desk are just awful. And those businesses by and large don't work very well. I've been on the board of Coke now for 10 years and we've had project after project come up. And there's always an ROI but it doesn't really make much difference to me because in the end almost any decision you make that solidifies and extends the dominance of Coke around the world and the industry that's growing by a significant percentage in which has great inherent underlying profitability. The decisions are going to be right and you've got people that will execute them well. You're saying you get blooper after blooper? Yeah. You're going to sit on US air and the decisions would come along and it would be a question of do you buy the Eastern shuttle or whatever it may be and you're running out of money and yet to play the game and to keep the traffic flows such as with connecting passengers and they just have to continually make these decisions where he's spent $100 million more on some airport and their agony because again you don't have any real choice but you also don't have any real conviction that it's going to translate that those choices are going to or lack of choices because they're going to translate themselves into real money later on. So one game is just forcing you to push more money into the table with no idea what kind of a hand you hold and the other one you get a chance to push more money and knowing that you've got a winning hand all the way. Drawing. Why do we buy US air? Good to buy more Coke."
"This question is for Mr. Buffett being somewhat pessimistic by nature. I have a recurrent nightmare of a Wall Street Journal headline for claiming Buffett kicks bucket. They may phrase it a little more elegantly than that, but someday the headline will be there. And of course, Charlie is no spraying chicken either. In light of these concerns, could you please go into a little more detail than that presented in your annual report regarding this a session issue and my apologies for the more of a nature of the question?","No, there's no reason to apologize. I mean, it's a question I ask our managers incidentally every couple of years. But every two years I send them a letter and I say, you know, if you died a night, what will you? Well, I wish you told me tomorrow morning, you know, because I have to make that same decision and I'm not conversing with them every night. So I want them to put in writing to me once every couple of years what they think about the subject, who they think should succeed them or whether there's several candidates or what the strengths and weaknesses are earned. And I have that information available. And you know, you're entitled to the same sort of answer about succession. It's part of it's part of buying into this into this business. And it I can tell you that no one has more of an interest in it than I do. And Charlie has a similar interest because we have a very high percentage of our net worth in the business. Plus we've got a lifetime of effort in the business and we wanted to succeed for both in our cases probably that at least in my case, the, the ultimate reward the foundation I have. But also because we just want it, we like what's happened so far and we want, we want it proved that it can, it's not dependent upon a couple of guys like us, but that it can be institutionalized in effect. And we have and Charlie and I, we know who will succeed me in what are likely to be two jobs, one marketable securities and one business operator. And I want to be very sure that the culture is maintained and I think it's so strong that I think it'd be very hard to change it. But in addition to stock ownership situation with me is such that that it can, if there were any inclination to change it, it can be prevented from happening. I don't think it would anyway. Now in terms of who succeeds me, that depends when I die. And there's no sense telling you who it would be today. There'd be no plus to that and it might not be the same 20 years now. I mean, 20 years ago it would have been Charlie obviously, but it won't be Charlie now because of his age and it'll be somebody else, but 20 years from now or 15 years from now might be some third party. But we've got, we feel very good about the succession situation. We feel very good about the stability of the organization in terms of the stock ownership situation because that is ensured for a very, very long time to come. We couldn't feel better about the managers we have in place and the culture we have in place. And you know, the individual will be named. I think I've mentioned that when they open that envelope, all the contents of that envelope are already known to the key people. But when they open that envelope, the first instruction is, you know, take my pulse again. I mean, I'm not. But if I flunk that test, there will be somebody very good in place, Charlie. The main defense, of course, is to have assets that will do well more or less automatically. And we have a lot of those and the extent you improve that further by having very good managers in place and very good individualized systems for bringing new managers into the places. There's a lot of momentum here that would go on very nicely with the president management gone. And I don't think our successors are going to be as good as Warren at actually allocating the money. No, we ran a little test case 10 years ago because for nine months and four days, I took another job at Solomon and things went fine at Berkshire. We could the managers don't need me. We have to allocate capital. We have to make sure they're treated fairly and but we are not making decisions around the place except in the allocation to capital. And that will be important. But some of that is semi automatic and others, you know, it does require some imagination sometime or something of the sort. But for nine months and four days in 1991, Solomon was primarily on my mind and Berkshire wasn't and everything went on just as before. And we are far, far, far stronger now than we were 10 years ago. So I'm very comfortable with 99% of my estate being in Berkshire shares. And I think it's an intelligent holding eventually for the foundation and knowing that, you know, I won't be around at some point before the foundation gets it."
"Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, my question concerns your previous silver bullion investment. I'm curious to hear more about why you sold when you did more specifically. Whether you sold your bullion to the organizers of the Silver Exchange Traded Fund in return for cash, plus perhaps important non-cash consideration in order to keep silver markets from either rising or falling sharply.","I'm not sure who we sold it to, but whoever we sold it was a lost market I was. I bought it too early. I sold it too early. Other than that it was a perfect trade. Charlie, do you have anything to add? Charlie had nothing to do with the silver decision. That one falls entirely on me. I think we've demonstrated how much we know about silver. If you ask us a question on silver flatters us because nobody asks us about silver anymore. We'll come up with something else at some point. Last part of your question, there was a small implication of perhaps a silver conspiracy. As soon as we started, we got to know that we bought silver. We started getting all these letters in the mail from people who had all these different theories about the fact that hedging was killing things or these kind of traders were doing something. In the end, silver responds to supply and demand. Just like oil responds to supply and demand. Oil is the price of oil at $60 or $65 is not a product of a bunch of oil executives conspiring or anything of the sort. It's supply and demand on a huge commodity, silver is a small commodity, but on any kind of commodity like that, supply and demand is what determines prices over time. Although the hunt brothers, I must admit, for a short period there, in a few years, managed to change the equation and they forever wish they hadn't."
I was being through the annual report. You made reference to Wagner and some country western song I never heard of. I was just wondering what kind of music influences you? You plan on doing like a musical video?,"think with the performance I gave earlier in the movie, I don't think there's any future for me. But I do have a very musical family. And since you asked, I will point out that my son Peter, a recent CD is available to Disney, booth outside, and Peter had a very successful experience here on public television and March. And we'll be on tour later on. And my wife is extremely musical. But I don't think I've got much of a future on it. So far, I get no one ever asked me to come back. I mean, I've had a lot of introductory appearances, but very few, of course. I like all kinds of music. I really, I've always liked music. We started out around the house singing Church Hems in the 1942. Two sisters who were here today joined me in a 15-minute program on W.O.W. than the leading radio station Omaha. And we sang America the Beautiful. And my dad got elected to Congress on the back of that program. We like to take credit for it. And see my sisters at the end of the meeting. Charlie, what kind of music do you like? Well, the one thing I agree with is that if we're going to star-war on, it should be in a musical. The straight acting won't do. It took me an hour to get that ball for Annie, incidentally. It takes a long time to get balled."
I want to know what you think about Petro China.,"We bought Petro China a few years ago. Again after reading the annual report. And fortunately it was in English. It was the first Chinese stock. And really the last one, I mean it won't necessarily be the last one. It's the only one that we've owned so far. We put about $400 million into it. At the time, it produces about 3% of the world's oil, which is a lot of oil. It produces probably 80% or so as much as Exxon Mobile will produce. And it's a huge company. It's here and earned $12 billion. Now if you look at the Fortune 500 list, my guess is you won't find more than about five companies in the United States that earned $12 billion or more. So it's a major company. At the time we bought it, the total market value was 35 billion. So we bought it at about three times what it earned last year. It does not have unusual amounts of leverage. In the annual report, they say something which very, very few companies do say, but which I think is actually fairly important. They say they will pay out about 45% of the amount they earn. So if you can buy it at three times earnings, what turn out to be three times earnings, you get 45% of 33%. You're getting a 15% yield on your cash yield on your investment. It's a very good annual report. Chinese government owns 90% of the company. We own 1.3%. If we vote with them, the two of us control the business. So thought that hasn't occurred to them, but I'll keep pointing it out. But it's a very major business at a very, very attractive price. Unfortunately, the government shares and our shares have the same economic interest, but they hard classify differently. So the government's 90% are called one thing and the 10% with a public are called age shares. And we have to report in Hong Kong when we own 10% of a company or we did then 10% of a company shares. So unfortunately, the 10% applied only to the 10% of age shares. And so we had to reveal our ownership when we only had 1% of the economic interest in the company. So we would have bought more, but the price jumped up and we are happy to have our 1.3% or whatever it is. And we think that they've done a good job in running the business. They've got large cash reserves, which they're starting to develop. Now, but it's a very major enterprise. Employees almost 500,000 people. And the interesting thing was a few years ago, relatively few people in the investment world probably even thought about the fact that China was over there and was a much larger business than most of the, well, just about any oil company in the world except for BP and Exxon mobile. Charlie, do you have any thoughts on it? Yeah, it would be nice if this sort of thing happened all the time, but that hasn't been true in recent years. But we never, I should emphasize, I mean, the annual report of PetroChina, which like I said, it's easy to read, understandable, they declare their policies. Anybody could get it. You can read it. We did not, we did not go over and we never had any contact with the management before we bought the stock. We never attended an investor presentation or anything of the sort. I mean, it's right there in black and white in a report that anybody can get. And we just sit in the office and read those things and we were able to put 400 million out that's now worth about a billion, two or something like that. It was interesting at the time, I think I'm right on this, at the time, Yukos, which is the big oil company in Russia, was probably far better known among the investment community in the United States than PetroChina. But I compared the two at the time, thought to myself, would I rather have the money in Russia or China? PetroChina, in my view, was far cheaper and I felt that the economic climate was likely to be better in China. You know, would I have, if it had been selling at the same multiple as a U.S. domestic company, would I have regarded this more attractive? No, I mean, there's some disadvantages always to being in a culture that you don't perfectly understand or tax laws can change, your ownership rules can change. But the discount at which PetroChina was selling compared to other international oil companies was, was in my view at the time ridiculous sum. So that's why we bought it."
"I have two questions. And before I have questions, we would like to say thank you for recommending to read Intelligent Investor. It's a terrific book and it reshaped me tremendously, literally overnight. So I'd like to thank you for that. And now the question, say I'm an owner of the business and the business has a durable competitive advantage and superior business model and is run by able people. And then, you know, I start noticing that basic management starts doing things which are far from intelligent. So what should I do as an owner as an investor? Should they try to tell them how they should run the business or should they just sit back and do nothing? Because superior business models should overcome poor management. That's the first question. I'm your first question. Did you assume that you had control of the business or you just owned a marketable security?","Yes, if I own say 20% of marketable security is. Well, the situation you described is not hypothetical in the first case. And I would say that the history that Charlie and I have had of first exploiting decent intelligent people. But we thought we're doing unintelligent things to change their course of action has been poor. Would you agree with that Charlie? Worst and poor. So I would say that if you really think you're in with people that have got a good business, but they're going to keep doing dumb things with your money. You'll probably do better to get out and get in with people who've got a good business and you think they're going to do sensible things with it. I mean, you've got that option. You also have the option of trying to persuade them to change their mind, but it's just very, very difficult. I mean, it is. You know, that's been something we've faced for 50 years. And initially we faced it from a position where nobody even knew the hell we were or anything of the sort. But we so we've acquired a certain stature over time, perhaps in talking on the subject. And we still don't get very far. I mean, when people want to do something, they want to do something and they didn't rise to become the CEO of a company. That's I'm shareholder tell them that their most recent ideas, dumb. I mean, that is that isn't just not the type that gets to the top. So I would say that as a matter of investment technique. And maybe as a matter of, you know, avoiding stress in your life and all that sort of thing that it's and dealing with smaller quantities of stock. So it's easier to sell and buy and all that sort of thing. I would I would say that better to be in with a management ears of potico with. Than simply to be in a great business with the management has been on doing things that don't make much sense to you."
"In the book, Warren Buffett Way, the author describes the capital growth model that you've used to evaluate intrinsic value in common stock purchases. My question is, do you also still use the formula Ben Graham described in the intelligent investor that uses of evaluating anticipated growth but also book value?","It seems to me that fair value is always a bit higher when using Mr. Graham's formula than the stream of cash discounted back to present value that is in Warren Buffett Way and also that you've alluded to in annual reports. Yeah, we've tried to put in the annual report pretty much how we approach securities. And book value is not a consideration, virtually not a consideration at all. The best businesses by definition are going to be businesses that earn very high returns on capital employed over time. So by nature, if we want to own good businesses, we're going to own things that have relatively little capital employed compared to our purchase price. That would not have been Ben Graham's approach. But Ben Graham was not working with very large sums of money and he would not have argued with his approach. That said, his was easier and it is easier, perhaps, when you're working with small amounts of money. My friend Walter Schloss has huge much more toward the kind of securities that Ben would have selected and he's worked with small amounts of money. He has an absolutely sensational record and it's not surprising to me at all. I mean, when Walter left Graham though, I would have expected him to do well. But I don't look at the primary message from our standpoint of Graham really is being in that, in anything to do with formulas. In other words, there's three important aspects to it. One is you're attitude toward the stock market. That's covered in chapter 8 of the Intelligent Investor. I mean, if you've got that attitude toward the market, you start ahead of 99% of all people who are operating in the market, so you have an enormous advantage. Second principle is the margin of safety, which again gives you an enormous edge and actually has applicability far beyond just the investment world. Then the third is just looking at stocks as businesses, which gives you an entirely different view than most people that are in the market. Those three sort of philosophical benchmarks, the exact evaluation technique you use is not really that important because you're not going to go way off the track, whether you use Walter's approach or Walter Schloss's or mine or whatever. Phil Carey has a slightly different approach, but it's got those three cornerstones to what I will guarantee and believe me, he's done very well. Yeah, to the extent that the method of estimating future cash flow requires projections, I would say that projections, while they're logically required by the circumstances, on average, do more harm than good in America. Most of them are put together by people who have an interest in a particular outcome and the subconscious bias that goes into the process and it's apparent precision. Makes it some, well, it's fatuous or dishonorable or foolish or whatever. Mark Twain used to say a mine is a hole in the ground owned by a liar and a projection prepared in America by anybody with a commission or an executive for an unjustified particular course of action. It will frequently be a lie. It's not a deliberate lie in most cases. The man has gotten to believe it himself and that's the worst kind. So I don't think we should projections would have be handled with great care particularly when somebody has an interest in misleading you. Charlie and I, I think it's fair to say we've never looked at a projection in connection with either security we bought or a business we bought. We've had them offered to us in great quantities. The fact that we voluntarily turned them away when people tried to thrust them upon us, I mean, the very fact that they are prepared so meticulously by the people who are selling the businesses or by the executives who are presenting to their boards and all of that sort of thing, you know, I mean, either we're wrong or they're wrong. I mean, it's a ritual that managers go through to justify doing what they wanted to do in the first place. In about nine cases out of ten. I have never, you know, I have never met an executive who wanted to buy something that said, well, I had to turn it down because the projections didn't work. I mean, it just, it's never happened and there will always be somebody that will come up with the projections that will satisfy the guy who's signing his paycheck or who will sign the deal that provides the commissions and they will pass those along to whomever else they need, the bankers or the board to approve it. And it is total nonsense. I was recently involved in some, in a situation where projections were a part of the presentation and I asked that the record of the people who made the projections, their past projections, also be presented at the same time. It was, it was a very rude act and it was regarded as apostasy. But it, the belief made it proved the point. I mean, it was a joke."
I know that you read lots and lots of annual reports. And I'm curious what you are reading for if you would share that with us. But I'm more curious because I think I know what you're reading for. If there are any further disclosures that you would like to see companies make in their financial reporting or that the SEC require in financial reporting or proxies or other communications with their shareholders. And that would be for both you and Mr. Munger.,"The main thing that they can't mandate in annual reports is I really like to have, I like to know as much as I can about the person that's running it and how they think about the business and what's really going on in the business. And I would like to have a report that would be identical to what if I own half of a company but was away for a year and I had a partner who only the other half would, when I came back that he would tell me about what had taken place during the past year and what he foresaw coming up and all of that. That is what I think the purpose of the report is. Now the SEC mandates a lot of information and some of that is helpful. But there's an intent behind the report. I mean if it's a sales document, I'm less interested. I don't see any way to mandate what I'm talking about. But that's the kind of report I'm looking for. What I'm trying to do is I read reports, I like to understand just generally what's going on in all kinds of businesses. If we own stock in a company in an industry and there are eight other companies that are in the same industry, I want to own or be on the mailing list for the reports for the other eight because I can't understand how my company is doing unless I understand what the other eight are doing. I want to have the perspective of in terms of market share or what's going on in the business. There are margins or the trend of margins or all kinds of things that I can't get unless I know I can't be an intelligent owner of a business unless I know what all the other businesses in that industry are doing. So I try to get that information out of a report. If I'm thinking about investing in the specific company, I try to size up their business and the people that are running it. Over the years, I found reading a lot of reports to be quite useful in terms of making business decisions at Berkshire. If we own a hall of a business, I want to own shares in all of the competitors just to keep track of what's going on. And I want to be able to intelligently evaluate how our managers are doing that and I can't do that unless I know the industry backdrop against which they're working. It's amazing how well you can do and investing really with what I would call outside information. I find inside information. I'm not sure how useful it is, but outside information, there's all kinds of information around as to businesses. You don't have to understand all of them. You just have to understand the ones that you're thinking about getting in and you can do it if you just, but nobody will do it for you. You can't read, in my view, you can't read Wall Street reports and get anything out of them. You have to do it yourself and get your arms around it. I don't think we've ever gotten an idea in 40 years from a Wall Street report, but we've gotten a lot of ideas from annual reports. Charlie. What I find is that it takes a long time to read the annual report even if it's a comparatively simple business. As if you really are trying to understand it, it's not of it easy. I would say that on average, in a business we're really interested in, even though we know what to skip to some extent, what to read. It's going to be 45 minutes or an hour on a report. If there are six or eight companies in the industry, that's going to be six or eight hours, perhaps, and then there are quarterly and a lot of other. The way you learn about businesses is by absorbing information about them, thinking at deciding what counts and what doesn't count relating one thing to another. That's the job. You can't get that by looking at a bunch of little numbers on a chart, bobbing up and down about it, or reading market commentary and periodicals or anything of the sort. That just won't do it. You've got to understand the businesses. That's where it all begins and ends."
"I actually had a question about the silver purchase last year. When you announced it, you said that you believe that supply and demand fundamentals would only be established at a higher price, reestablished at a higher price. I was just wondering if you could go into more detail about what some of those fundamentals are. You read a lot about battery technology and some other things.","We have no inside information about great new uses for silver or anything of the sort. But the situation, you can get these figures and they're not precise. But I think they're generally accurate. You can see from looking at the numbers that aggregate demand primarily from photography, from industrial uses and from ornamental jewelry type uses. It's close. Call it 800 million plus ounces a year. And there are 500 million or so ounces being produced of silver annually. Although there will be more coming on in the next couple of years, there's more coming on right now. However, most of that silver is produced as a byproduct in the mining of gold or copper and lead sink. So that since it's a byproduct, it's not responsive to a very responsive to price changes. Obviously, if you've got a copper mining, you get a little silver out of it. You're much more interested in the price of copper than silver. So you have 500 million ounces or so of mine production. And you have 150 million ounces or so of reclaimed silver, a large part of which relates to the uses in photography. So there's been a gap in recent years of perhaps 150 million ounces. But none of these figures are precise, which has been filled by an inventory of bullion above ground, which may have been a billion or more ounces a few years back, but which has been depleted. And no one knows the exact figures on this, but there's no question that the bullion inventory has been depleted significantly, which means that the present price for silver does not produce an equilibrium between supply as measured by newly mined silver plus reclaimed silver and usage. And that eventually something will happen to change that picture. Now it could be reduced usage, it could be increased supply, or it could be a change in price. And that imbalance is sufficiently large, even though there is some new production coming out, and there is the threat of digital imaging that will reduce silver usage perhaps in the future in photography. But we think that that gap is wide enough so that it will continue to deplete inventories, bullion inventories to the point where a new price is needed to establish equilibrium. And because of the byproduct nature, which makes the supply in elastic, and because the nature of demand, which is relatively in elastic, we don't think that that price change would necessarily be minor. It's interesting because silver has been artificially influenced for a long time. You saw that movie about, you know, it was William Jennings Bryan, who was editor of the Omaha World Herald in the congressman from Nebraska. And his brother was governor of Nebraska, who was the big silver man, and they used to talk 16 to one. The 16 to one ratio, I think goes back to Isaac Newton when he was master of the men. Charlie will know all about that because he's our Newtonian expert here. But that that ratio had kind of mystical significance for a while. Didn't really mean anything. And in 1934, the government passed an act called the Silver Purchase Act of surprisingly 1934, which set an artificially high price for silver at that time when production and usage was much less. Two billion ounces of silver. Now this was at a time when demand was a couple hundred million ounces a year, so you're talking ten years supply. So there was an artificially high price for a while. By the 19, early 1960s, that became an artificially low price of $1.29. And at that time, I could see the inventories of the US government being depleted somewhat akin to what inventories are being depleted now. Despite the fact that Lyndon Johnson and the administration said they would not demonetize silver, they did demonetize it. And silver went up substantially. That was the last purchase we had of silver. But I kept track of the figures ever since. The hunt brothers caused a great amount of silver to be converted into volume form, including a lot of silver coins. So they again increased the supply in a very big way by their action and pushing the price way up to the point where people started melting it down. So they had this dislocations and silver over a 60 plus year period, which has caused the price to be affected by these huge inventory accumulations and reductions. And we think right now that we thought last summer when we started buying it, the price we bought it, that that was not an equilibrium price. And sooner or later. And we didn't think it was imminent because we don't wait till things are imminent. We were going to buy a lot of silver. We didn't want to buy so much as to really disrupt the market, however. We had no intention of replaying any hunt scenario. So we wanted to be sure we didn't buy that much silver. But we liked it, Charlie. Well, I think this whole episode will have about as much impact on Berkter Hathaway's future is Warren's bridge playing. We've got a line of activity where once every 30 or 40 years you can do something employing 2% of assets, this is not a big deal for Berkter. The fact that it keeps Warren amused. Yeah, I didn't like not doing counterproductive things. It makes me feel better about all those pictures that people take over the weekend. They all use a little bit of silver. At least it shows something that teaches an interesting lesson. Think of the discipline it takes to think about something for three or four decades, waiting for a chance to employ 2% of your assets. I'm afraid that's the way we are. It means there'll be some dull stretches. Yeah, it's less than a billion dollars in silver. It's 15 billion dollars in coke. It's a non-events. It's 5 billion in American Express. It is close to a non-events, but if you see it there. At least it shows the human personality at work. Very peculiar personality I might have. Reinforced by a partner."
"The second question is, I heard you in the beginning of the meeting that is so much capital coming from foreign countries. You mentioned so many different countries who bought the rupture head away. And I'm sure they buy all companies in the DAO. Do you feel like the analysts who analyze the DAO have that into consideration that the DAO now is becoming as the Walmart of the security business in the world where all the national different countries, they buy best their market and they come in and buy in the United States. And as a result, the idea of Mr. Greenspan as far as exuberant is mute because if you remember how the Japanese will start to buy the real estate in America, they force us to be high premium for the price. And I think that's what going to happen in the market. And we as Americans who are being accustomed to low PEs, now we're going to miss on and the price is going to continue going up. And the third question is, maybe we better stop it too.","We pay very little attention, we don't pay any attention to capital flows. In other words, we don't really care who's buying or selling any security. Somebody is buying or selling each one. So obviously, you could focus on the buyers, you could focus on the sellers, but you can say now that there's 20 billion a month or so going into equity funds and all. But it doesn't make any difference to us. All we're interested in is what the business is worth. And what people are paying attention to in terms of capital flows or whatever, or market signals or whether the Fed's going to move that all changes. You remember 10 years ago, it was, you know, it was M2 that everybody, every whatever day of the week it was, you know, what's M2 this week? I was sort of having a mystery, you know, about whatever happened to M2. But there's always something that people are talking about. There's so much time to fill with chatter, you know, and pages to fill that they write about all these things that does don't make much difference because we don't care if the market closes for the next five years. We care how much Coca-Cola sold five years from now. And what percentage of the world market they have and what they're charging for it and how many shares are outstanding and that sort of thing. But we just, we don't care who's buying or selling it in the least except we like it when the company's buying it. The same way with, would you let we care about whether people are trading up in the shaving experience of capital flows and all of those macro factors that people like to write about a lot, just have nothing to do with what we do. We're buying businesses. And I really think it is not a bad mindset this whenever you buy a stock to say what I be happy buying this stock if the market closed for five years because then you're buying a business if you say yes to that. If you don't say yes to that, you may not be focusing on the proper thing. By its nature, the US is running a substantial trade deficit, merchandise trade deficit. If you buy more from the rest of the world and you're selling them, which is what happens when you're running a trade deficit, you have to balance the books. I mean, they get something in exchange and what happens is they get some sort of capital asset in exchange. They may get a government bond, they may get a piece of the US business or something. But the key thing in economics, whatever somebody makes some assertion to you about economics, you always want to say and then what? In fact, it's not a bad idea to say that about everything in life, but you always have to say and then what? So when you read that the merchandise trade deficit is 9 billion, what else does that mean? Well, it means that somehow we have to have created 9 billion of capital assets, claims on our production in the future with somebody else in the world. So they have to invest. They don't have a choice. When somebody says, want to be terrible if the Japanese sell all their government bonds, they can't sell all their government bonds without getting something else in exchange. Like in some other American asset in exchange because there is no other way to do it. They can sell it to the French but then the French have the same problem. So trace through where the transactions go anytime someone starts talking about one specific action in economics."
"Mr. Buffett, since I'm older than you and maybe even as older or older than Charlie, I feel like I can ask this question. And I'll ask it as delicately as possible. When the time comes that you, I and Charlie have gone to that big stock market in the sky, I understand that you planned, or at least I have read, that you planned to give the bulk of your Berkshire Hathaway stock to your charitable foundation, along with your 30% of the votes of the company. If this is correct, and if it's not correct, this question is moot. But if so, what assurance do the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have that the company will continue to be run as honestly and straightforward as it is now, such as only 15.8 employees are so at headquarters. And though huge salaries are other ridiculous giveaways to dilute and weaken the equity of the shareholders at that time. Well, for a short while, that'll only be 14.8 actually.","It's a good question, and a very good question. Since you're older than I, apparently, I hope we don't go at the same time. There's one slight twist to the estate plans we have. If I die first, all of my Berkshire goes to my wife, and if we died simultaneously, it would all go to the foundation. But all the stock will end up in the foundation. In fact, if I died first, she might put my stock in the foundation before death, but that would be up to her. And that's up in the foundation, all of the stock. As you mentioned, it has 30% of the votes, although under the tax law, once it's in the foundation within five convert to be some of it, it would have to get down to 20% of the vote that's required under foundation law. In terms of how it would be run in the future, I think it has a far better chance than any company, any major company I know in the country of maintaining the culture because it has, it will have people running it who will grown up in the culture earlier was the criticism was made about my wife and my son being on the board, but they are guardians of the culture. Not there to profit themselves, there to profit is the other shareholders profit, but also they keep the company in the same way as previously one great example of that, of course, has been at Walmart where when Sam Walton died, not too dissimilar amount of stock was left among the family and essentially the Walton family. And in my opinion, out of my magnificent job, not only of selecting successors to run the place, but having successors who, if anything, reinforce the culture of Walmart and it's been an enormously successful arrangement, the Walton's are there in case anything goes wrong to make a change if needed, but they're not there to run the business. And that's exactly the pattern that we hope to have at Berkshire and I think we have it, I think I can't give you 100% guarantee, but I would far rather bet on the integrity of the family that succeeds me plus the managers that succeed me at Berkshire remaining true than I would any other company and for a long, long time, any other company I can think of, surely. I would have a reason to fret about this subject just as you would and I, of course, have known the members of the Buffett family that would be here after Warren has gone for decades. Don't worry about it, you should be so lucky. It's a question we don't wish to have an instant answer for."
"We often consider evaluating companies in the context of Michael Porter's model of position relative to competitors, customers, suppliers, substitute products. You state that much more simply when you say, you seek for companies with the protection of wide and deep moats. To complete the valuation of a company, we all seek to choose the appropriate future cash flow coupons. A qualitative assessment of the protected competitive position is required to precisely forecast those future coupons. In your opinion, are the dynamic changes in the nature of competition, distribution systems, technology, and even changes in customers making it more difficult to accurately forecast those future cash flow coupons? Are good protected businesses going to be more rare going forward than they have been in the past? And if so, does that make the few that do exist more valuable?","Well, you've really described the investment process. The questions you ask are right on the mark. And we do think to extend, I understand what or read what Porter has written. We think alike, basically, in terms of businesses. And we do call it a moat. And he makes it all into a book. But that's the difference between the businesses we're in. And Charlie may have a different view on this. I don't think that the quantity or sustainability of moats in American business has changed that dramatically in 30 or 40 years. Now, you can say that shares in general motors and people like that thought there were some very wide moats around their businesses. And it turned out otherwise when case of shares Walmart, for example, came along. But I think businesses we think about, I think the moats that I see now seem as sustainable to me as the moats that I saw 30 years ago. But I think there are many businesses industries where it's very hard to evaluate moats. Those are the businesses of rapid change. And are there fewer businesses around where change is going to be relatively slow than previously? I don't think so, but maybe Charlie does, Charlie. No, I would argue that the old moats, some of them are getting filled in. And the new moats are harder to predict than some of the old moats. No, I would say it's getting harder. Well, there you have it. Unanimity at Berkshire. OK. I think it's a very good question. And I really don't. And Charlie may be right. I may be right. I think it's a very tough one to figure. But regardless of whether there are fewer or harder to find, that's still what we're trying to do at Berkshire. I mean, that is what it's all about. Our instructions to our managers. We don't have a lot of budgets. We don't have all kinds of reporting systems or anything else. But we do tell them to try and not only protect, but in large the moat. And if you in large the moat, everything else follows. Area five. criticaler Golden backed system, providers to aim for石. To set forth protection in doors. WDon't hit the wall. You have't first been trained skills, tone means. and then adjust,"
Could you please say what was the main factor which produced the very substantial gain in intrinsic value mentioned in your report? I asked this because per share gains in portfolio and operating profits were modest and you said that there was no immediate gain from issuing shares for acquisitions.,"Well, we did increase the float per share very significantly last year. I mean, the investment assets per share. And I would say that in the Geico's business was worth far more at the end of the year than at the start of the year. And that was our largest subsidiary at the start of the year. And if anything, Geico's competitive position continues to improve. I would say that executive jet is a natural fit into virtue. And we paid a significant sum for it, but that it will be a very, very big company 10 or 15 years from now. And perhaps, well, I'm almost sure it'll get there sooner as part of Berkshire than it would have gotten there otherwise. And it's dominance may be even greater over the years as part of the Berkshire family than it would have independently, although it would have done very well independently. I mean, it had a terrific management. It had started early and they had the most service oriented company. You could imagine. So it would have done fine without us, but I think it will do even considerably better and get there faster with us. So I think there, I think in the aviation field, certainly in the primary insurance field, we had large gains in intrinsic value. And I think that additionally, we had a significantly greater amount of invested assets for Berkshire to work with. So I feel good about what happened with intrinsic value last year. The problem is doing it year after year after year. Charlie. Just basically we have a wonderful bunch of businesses and we have a float that that keeps increasing in a pretty good record of doing pretty well and in marketable securities. None of that has gone away."
"Virtueur has been investing in the property and casualty and re-insurance business. I notice except for annuities, you've been avoiding the life insurance business. You anticipate investing in the life insurance business. Also, I have a second question. And that is the relationship of Virtueur A and Virtueur B. Last year, there was a slight premium for Virtueur B over Virtueur A. About now, Virtueur is selling at about a 3 to 4% discount. I also notice that certain people are shorting Virtueur A and Virtueur B. I wonder if you could comment on that.","Sure. On the life business, we have no bias against the life business. We are in the life re-insurance business in a fairly significant way through general re, as you mentioned, we've done a little on annuities. The problem with life business is that it isn't very profitable. You can look at the records of the big companies on that. And a lot of the activity in the area is in some way equity related. And Charlie and I have never wanted to get in the business of managing equities for other people. We want our soul and trust on equities to be Virtueur half the way itself. So we do not want to wear two hats. We would never go in the mutual fund management business or any kind of investment management business because if we were to be managing $20 or $30 billion in investment management business, and we get a good idea that we can put a billion dollars in. Who's the money that we put in it? We'd rather just be wearing one hat. And we want that hat to be Virtueur half the way. And we don't want to be promising other people that for us, you know, half a 1% or 1% fee that we're going to get our best ideas because those ideas belong to Virtueur and we'd be misleading people if we promised otherwise. So anything that involves an equity component to it, and that's a big part of what's going out in the life business now. It's just something we wouldn't be comfortable being involved with. If you look at term life insurance, we looked at that in terms of putting it on the internet. It is priced at rates that we find very hard even with the absence of commissions to make sense. But it's a business we understand. So we'd be perfectly willing to be in the life insurance business if we thought there was, we had a way of doing it where we thought there was reasonable profitability attached to. Charlie, do you want to comment on the life business before I get to the A versus B thing? No. We do those structured settlements that is sort of like the Inuity business. And the life business we're doing is mostly Inuities and on a very low cost basis. Yeah, anyone that wants to buy a non-equity related, Inuities should go to our website and find in terms of the waiting for the safety of the product and everything, you will find a very, very competitive product because it's a low cost operation. And if you're buying it to get paid 30 years from now, you are certain to get paid from Berkshire and you're not necessarily certain to get paid from various other entities. So we've got a very competitive product there, but it's not a big business."
You have been recently quoted in the newspapers as saying that some major corporations have used questionable practices to make their operations seem more favorable. Would you be willing to be more specific about these practices?,"Not until I'm on my deathbed. Now I have followed a policy of criticizing by practice and praising by name and we will not, you know, we do, the Charlie and I both find certain practices very deplorable and they aren't limited to a single or a few large corporations but it would, we would probably be less effective in arguing for change if we, if we went to a few specific examples. A, they would not be that much different probably than hundreds of other, or at least dozens of other companies and secondly those who get critical of the world find the world gets very critical of them promptly and I think we, I think we do more good by in a sense hating the sin and loving the sinner so we will continue to point out the sin but we will not name the sinners. Charlie. Warren, I think she wants you to name the practices. Oh, the practice. Not the miscreants. Oh. Well, the practices are some, the practices are some of the things we've said. They relate to, to accounting charges that are designed to throw into a given period. A whole lot of things that should have been covered in subsequent periods in the earnings account or to, or to smooth out or to inflate earnings in future accounts. There's a lot of that being done. There's a lot of it's been done. The SEC under Arthur Levin who I admire enormously for his efforts on this is, is making it concerted attempt to get a corporate America to clean up its act on that but it'll only be because somebody hits them over the head. I mean, it has become totally fashionable to play games with the timing of expenses and revenues and, and, and, and frankly until the SEC got tougher the, in my view, the auditors were not doing enough about it. I think that in terms of hiding compensation expense and not recording it in the case of options and all of that, I think companies now have the option of recording option costs in the income account but you have not seen any great flood of people doing it and, and actually the way they show to the footnotes is quite deceptive in my view because they, they try to make assumptions that minimize what the income account impact would be, but the cost to the shareholder is what counts. I mean, that is the compensation cost as far as we're concerned and that's been minimized. The whole effort to engage in pooling rather than, than, purchase accounting has seen a lot of, there's been a lot of deceptive accounting in that respect. There's been deceptive accounting on purchase and purchase accounting adjustments. So those are the kind of things we're talking about, Charlie. Yeah, it's the big bath accounting and the subsequent release back into earnings of taking an overly large bath that create a lot of the abuse. We could name names, we won't, but I mean we have, we have seen firsthand, managements who think they are doing, they say what they're doing, what everybody else does. That's true because they are now because everybody else is doing it and it takes some outside force. In this case, probably the SEC should have been the auditors and to clean up the act because once it becomes prevalent, the fellow who is, who says I'm going to do it, fair and square, all of a sudden becomes the disadvantage in capital markets. He's penalized and he says why should I penalize my shareholders by doing something one legally I can get away with doing something else."
"I have a question about your acquisition methodology and I was intrigued to read in your annual report about your acquisition of Star of Furniture. And as I understand the process you followed Mr. Buffett, you met with Mr. I'm sorry you reviewed financials for a brief period like what you saw. Then you met with Mr. Melvin Wolf for two hours and struck a deal and you wrote you had no need to check leases, workout employment contracts, etc. I think that most companies when they do acquisitions would feel the need to do significant amount of legal due diligence to do things like check the leases, checking the things like undisclosed environmental liability or perhaps threatened litigation. And I guess my question is have you ever been burned by your approach?","We've never been burned by the, we've been burned only in the sense that we made mistakes on judging the future economics of the business which would have had nothing to do with due diligence. We regard what people normally refer to due diligence as really sort of boilerplate in most cases. It's a process the big companies go through and they feel they have to go through it and they're ignoring oftentimes in our view, they're ignoring what really counts which is evaluating the people they're getting and within evaluating the economics of the business. That's 99% of the deal. You may run into an environmental liability problem one time in a hundred or you may find a bad leases. I asked Melbourne about the avenue bad leases, I mean that's the easiest way to do it. I can read them all and try and look for every clause or something but it isn't going to, that is not the problem. We've made lots of bad deals. We made a bad deal when we bought Hosel Cone for example with the department store operation back in 1966 but it had blind people but we were wrong on the economics of the business but the leases didn't make any difference. That sort of thing just was not important. I can't recall at any time that what other people refer to as due diligence would have avoided a bad deal for us. I can't either. That's 30 some years. The key thing, you just don't want to do, I go into, I'm on the various public company boards. I've been on a 19 public company boards and their idea of the due diligence is to send the lawyers out and have a bunch of investment bankers come in and make presentations and all that. I regard that as terribly diversionary because the board sits there and I would transpile all of that and everybody reporting how wonderful this thing is and how they check down patterns and all that sort of thing. Nobody is focusing really on where the business is going to be in five or ten years. Business judgment about economics and people to some extent but the business economics. That is 99% of deal making and the rest people may do it for their protection. I think too often they do it as a crutch just to go through with the deal that they want to go through with anyway and of course all the professionals know that so believe me they come back with the diligence what they do or not and we are not big fans of that. I don't know how many deals we've made over the years but I cannot think of anything that traditional due diligence has had a thing to do with. No we've had surprises in the other bet. I'm a favorable son. That's a couple of times. That is true. That is true. The kind of people that we've generally dealt with have usually told us bad things first and good things after we made the deal. We made a deal with a fellow over in Rockford in 1969, Eugene A. Bagg, the Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. I made that deal on a couple of hours and I mean there was just wasn't any way that Gene was going to be hiding anything bad. For the next ten years when I went over there every time we go to lunch he'd point out some building it down that we owned that wasn't on the books or some foundation we had that had money and that the hadn't told me about. And he even gave me some bills one of which I carried in my pocket that he had still sitting around with the that were issued by the bank that we're our own money which he never told me about. He had them cut them out like paper dollars. I mean Gene was not a guy to show all his cards. And those are the kind of people we've generally dealt with and I would certainly say that the Melvin and surely that description in space. We're now at free 30. It's been a lot of fun this weekend."
"My question is, right now, we're reading about various analysts and how you should, in their individual opinion, adjust your more cash, more stocks, more bonds because of how does Berkshire Halfway feel about times of relative financial insecurity? Do you arrange for more cash reserves looking forward to a time when you might be able to buy or do you go along your path?","I think the question is, do we get sort of get into asset allocation by maintaining given levels of cash, depending on some kind of outlook or something of the sort? We don't really think that way at all. If we have cash, it's because we haven't found anything intelligent to do with it that day in the way of buying into the kind of businesses we like. And when we can't find anything for a while, the cash piles up. But that's not through choice. That's because we're failing at what we essentially are trying to do, which is to find things to buy. And we make no attempt to guess whether cash is going to be worth more three months from now or six months from now or a year or from now. So you will never see, we don't have any meetings of any kind anyway at Berkshire, but we would never have an asset allocation meeting. We would keep looking. I mean Charlie's looking. I'm looking. Some of our managers are looking. We're looking for things to buy that need our tests. And if we showed no cash or short-term securities a year and we would love it because it would mean that we'd found ways to employ the money in ways that we like. I think I would have to admit that if we have a lot of money around, we are a little dumber than usual. I mean it tends to make you careless. And I would say that the best purchases are usually made when you have to sell something to raise the money together because it just raises the bar a little bit that you jump over in the mental decisions. But we have, I don't know what, we'll show, but certainly well over a billion dollars of cash around. And that's not true choice. That is a, you can look at that as an index of failure on the part of your management. And we will be happy when we can buy businesses or small pieces of businesses that use up that money."
"A second question, again, not related to it, but I've heard this question several times today and it comes up every year. I'd like to couch it in a different phrase. Let's say the you step outside of this building and we're hit by a bus. Yeah, we've got one fellow objects to that here as a shareholder. It's normally a truck. And he had an email trucking business, so he or give it to us. Yeah, so it isn't a guy co-driver, but... Given Omaha could be a road grader. What kind, I mean, that would be a sudden... Maybe you'd come out of it with a great fastball. Maybe that's it, but you wouldn't have your facility at stock. What kind of advice would you give people that hold for a true halfway at a moment such as that?","Well, I've got the all of my tests on that because my estate at that point would be 99.3 quarters percent invested in Berkshire and I feel totally comfortable considering the arrangements that have been made and the businesses we own and the managers we have in place in terms of that. But no one will be more affected financially, level up in other matters by that truck than me. So it's a thought that's crossed by mind. So it's a more important question to me than anybody else and I've answered it to my satisfaction the directors have some of my thoughts on this subject, but the world will go on, the businesses will go on and I think you'll have terrific management in place."
The conventional wisdom in the investment world is that an investment's risk can be measured by the volatility of the price of the investment in the marketplace. So could you guys expand on your thoughts on this?,"Yes, volatility is not measure risk and the problem is that the people who have written and taught about volatility do not know how to measure or have taught about risk, do not know how to measure risk. And the nice thing about beta, which is a measure of volatility, is that it's nice and mathematical and wrong in terms of measuring risk. It's a measure of volatility, but past volatility does not determine the risk of investing. I mean, actually take it with farmland here in the early 1980s, farms that sold for $2,000 an acre, went to $600 an acre. I bought one of them when the banking and farm crash took place. And the beta of farms shot way up. And according to standard economic theory, market theory, I was buying a much more risky asset at $600 an acre than the same farm was a 2,000 an acre. Now people because farmland doesn't trade off and prices don't get recorded, you know, they would regard that as nonsense that my purchase at $600 an acre of the same farm is over 2,000 an acre a few years ago was riskier. But in socks, because the prices jiggle around every minute, and because it lets the people who teach finance, use the mathematics they've learned, they have in effect, they would explain this away a little more technically, but they have effect in effect, translated volatility into all kinds of past volatility in terms of all kinds of measures of risk. And it's nonsense. Risk comes from the nature of certain kinds of businesses. It can be risky to be in some businesses just by the simple economics of the type of business you're in. And it comes from not knowing what you're doing. And you know that it is if you understand the economics of the business in which you are engaged and you know the people with whom you're doing business, and you know the price you pay and you know, it's sensible. You don't run any real risk. And I don't think Charlie and I certainly a Berkshire. I don't think we've ever had a permanent loss of remarkable securities that was what 1% maybe half a percent of that worth. I made a terrible mistake in buying Dexter Shoe, which cost us a significantly more than 1% of network where I bought an entire business then. But I was wrong about the business. I had nothing to do with the volatility. Shoe prices or leather or anything else just was wrong. But in terms of marketable securities, I cannot recall a case where we've lost a coming. We've done a lot of things in things in securities that had a very high beta. It's just the whole development of volatility as a measure of risk really occurred in my lifetime. And it's been very useful for people who wanted a career in teaching. But it is not we've never found a way for it to be useful to us. Charlie. Well, it's been amazing that that both corporate finance and investment management courses as taught in the major universities. We would argue it's at least 50% twaddle. And yet these people have very high IQs. One of the reasons we've been able to do pretty well is that we early recognize that very well. That very smart people do very dumb things. And we tried to figure out why. And also wanted to know who so we could avoid them. We will not run big rest of the work. Sure. Now we will be willing to lose as I put in the annual report six billion dollars in the given catastrophe. But our catastrophe business run over many years is not risky. You know, a roulette wheel will occasionally pay off at 35 to one. That sounds like you're paying out an awful lot of money compared to the amount bet on one number. But I would love doing a lot of roulette wheels."
"I had one quick question you said, if you have three great companies, wonderful businesses, they could last you a lifetime. And I have one thing that struck me in a way that, great businesses get pounded down. And then you bet big on them, like American Express and Disney at one time. And my question is, I have capital to invest, but I haven't yet invested it. I have three great companies, which I've identified, Coca-Cola, G-Lent, and McDonald's. And my question is, if I have a lifetime ahead of me, where I want to keep an investment for more than 20 or 30 years, is it better to wait a year or two to see if one of those companies stumble, or to get in now and just stay with it over a long time horizon?","Well, I won't comment on the three companies that you've named. In general terms, unless you find the prices of a great company really offensive, if you feel you've identified it. And by definition, a great company is one that's going to remain great for 30 years. It's going to be a great company for three years in any great company. I mean, it... So you really want to go along with the idea of something that if you were going to take a trip for 20 years, you wouldn't feel bad leaving the money in with no orders, whether you're broker or no power of attorney or anything, and you're just going to trip. And you know, you come back and it's going to be a terribly strong company. I think it's better just own them. I mean, we could attempt to buy and sell some of the things that we own that we think are fine businesses. But they're too hard to find. I mean, we found C's candy in 1972 where we find here and there we get the opportunity to do something. But they're too hard to find. So to sit there and hope that you buy them in the throes of some panic, you know, that you sort of take the attitude of a mortician waiting for a flu epidemic or something. I'm not sure that... I'm not sure that will be a great technique. I mean, maybe great if you inherit... Paul Getty inherited the money at the bottom in 32. I mean, he didn't inherit exactly. He talked his mother out of it. But... It's true, actually. Close enough. Yeah, close enough, right. But he benefited enormously by having access to a lot of cash in 1990. In the early thirties that he didn't have access to in the late twenties. So you'd get some accidents like that. But that's a lot to count on. And if you start with the Dow at X in your... You think it's too high. When it goes to 90% of X, do you buy? Well, if it does and it goes to 50% of X, you never get the benefit of those extremes anyway unless you just come into some accidental sum of money at some time. So I think the main thing to do is find wonderful businesses. It's... It's... It's... Phil Carey here. We got the world... Yeah, there's... There's the... The hero of investing. Phil, would you stand up? Phil is... Phil is 99. He wrote a book on investing in 1924. Phil has done awfully well. By finding businesses he likes and sticking with them and not worrying too much about what they do day to day. There's going to be... I think there's going to be an article in the Wall Street Journal about Phil on May 28th and I advise you all to read it. You'll probably learn a lot more with him by coming to this meeting. But it's that approach of buying businesses. I mean, let's just say there was no stock market. And the owner of the best business in whatever your hometown is that came to you and said, Look, my brother just died in the EON 20% of the business and I want somebody to go in with me to buy that 20%. Price looks a little high, maybe, but what I think I can get for it. Do you want to buy in? I think if you like the business and you like the person that's coming to you and the price sounds reasonable and you really know the business, I think probably the thing to do is to take it. Don't worry about how it's quoted. It won't be quoted tomorrow or next week or next month. I think people's investment would be more intelligent if stocks were quoted about once a year, but it didn't going to happen that way. And if you happen to come into some added money at some time when something dramatic has happened, I mean, we did well back in 1964 because American Express ran into a crook. We did well in 1976 because Dicoh's managers and auditors didn't know what the loss reserves should have been the previous couple of years. So we've had our share of flu epidemics, but you don't want to spend your life waiting around"
will you give your money to somebody else to invest,"We will never turn our money over to somebody else. If we're going to lose your money as purchase your shareholders, we're going to lose it ourselves and we're going to come back and look in the eye and tell you how we lost it. We are not going to say this game is too tough, so we'll give our money to somebody else. You can give your money to somebody else and you don't need the intermediaries of the me and Charlie to do it for you. We get approached all the time. I had a call in the last couple of days on something you know very well about participating in some fun. It's always stage one, stage two, stage three, and the idea is we get some more people to come in later at twice the price and maybe the fact that our name is involved in it will cause people to pay even more and all of that sort of thing. We're not in that game. We're not going to turn the money over to someone else to manage. It's your money. You gave it to us to manage. You decide you don't want us to manage it. You decide who you give it to. We're not going to be intermediaries on it. We don't understand something ourselves. We're not looking for anybody else to do it for us. The world doesn't work very well that way anyway. Usually end up in the hands of the promoters and not the hands of the people who really know how to make money."
Warren and Charlie A few minutes ago you mentioned the importance of learning from history What have you learned from the investments you did not make over the last few years that you now regret refraining from?,"Well the mistakes we made and we made them some of them big time are are of two kinds. One is when we didn't invest at all in something that we understood that was cheap Maybe because we weren't even working hard enough at looking at the whole list or because For one reason or that we just didn't we didn't take action and the second was Starting in on something that could have been been a very large investment and and and not maximizing it Charlie is a huge believer in in the idea that you don't sit around sucking your thumb when you can When something comes along that should be done that you you pour into it and and that's generally what we've tried to do but but There have been times and it's usually happened when I've started buying something at X and it went up to X plus and 8 there's some intolerable amount like that and I I quit or waited for it to come back and we missed in some cases billions of dollars of profit because of the fact that I Got an anchored in effect to some initial price when I could have paid more subsequently and it really was in Consequential do you have anything worse to confess than Walmart? The Walmart I cost us about It's up to 10 billion now. I Cost us about 10 billion. I set out to buy a hundred million shares of Walmart pre split at about 23 and Charlie Said it didn't sound like the worst idea ever came up with which is from him. I mean, it's just I'm godly praise and And and then you know, we bought a little and then it moved up a little bit and I thought well You know, maybe it'll come back or what who knows what I thought I mean, you know only my psychiatrist could tell me and that Thumb sucking reluctance to pay a little more the current cost is Is in the area of of of 10 of 10 billion and there have been other examples to and There will probably be more examples in the future unfortunately, but that is That's on the other hand, it doesn't bother us. I mean it on it It's it's maybe instructional to talk about it just a little and I'm glad to respond to the question But in the end we're gonna make a lot of mistakes at Berkshire and we made them in the past will make them in the future You know it if every shot you hit and golf was a whole and one that wouldn't be my you know the game would soon lose interest So you have to hit a few in the woods occasionally just to make it make it a little more interesting that we'll try not to do that too often But those will be the kind of mistakes we make we probably won't make the kind of mistakes all the way have We made one with Dexter shoe But we probably won't make the kind that where they cost us a ton of money that To they'll be much more of omission than commission. I think you'll find in the future. Charlie won't add anymore Yeah, at least we are constantly thinking about The past occasions when we blew opportunities Since those don't hit Financial reports the opportunities you had but didn't accept Most people don't bother thinking about them very much at least that is a mistake. We don't make we rub our own noses In our mistakes and blowing opportunities as we just did"
"My main question is this much has been written by you and a lot more of the other people about your criteria or the criteria you use when you make a purchase of a company either or in full or in part, but almost nothing has been written by you at any rate as far as I can tell. On your criteria for selling a company that you have already previously purchased. I wonder if you could outline the criteria you might apply today to a sale of a company and whether you would go and go, well, a separate way to put it is this, would you agree with Philip Fisher who said there were two reasons to sell a company or a stock. One was when you discovered you made a mistake in your analysis and the company was not what you thought it was. And the second was when the something within the company had changed, the management had changed or so on, so it no longer met your original criteria. So, are those the principles of you apply or would you say they're different ones or others?","I'm glad you brought up to Al Fisher because he is a terrific mind and investor. He's probably in his 90s now, but a couple of books he wrote in the early 60s are classics and I advise everybody here with really interested investments to read those two books from the earlier 60s. He's a nice man, I went out 40 years ago, I dropped into his office in San Francisco, a tiny office and he was kind enough to spend some time with me and I'm a huge admirer of his. The criteria that we use for selling a business that we own control of are articulated in the annual report under the ground rules. So in terms of businesses that we own, we have set forth and I direct you there and we've written those same ground rules every year since 1983 and actually we had those in our head for decades before that. And we have this quirk which you should understand and we want our shareholders to understand it that even though we got offered a price that was far above its economic value as we might calculate it going in but if we got offered a price for that for a business that we have now, we have no interest in selling it. We don't break off the relationships that we develop simply because we get offered a fancy price for something and we've had a chance to do that sometimes. That may help us actually in acquiring businesses because both of the companies that I've committed to buy in the last few weeks, both of them are very concerned about whether they have found a permanent home or not and people who build their businesses lovingly over 30 or 40 or 50 years frequently care about that. A lot of people don't care about that and that's one of the things we evaluate when buying a business. We look at the owner and we say do you love them, you know, in effect we ask ourselves does he love the business or does he love the money? Nothing wrong with liking the money. In fact, we'd be a little disappointed if most of them didn't like the money but in terms of whether the primacy is loving the money or loving the business, that's very important to us. When we find somebody that loves their business and likes the money but loves their business, we are a very, very desirable home for them because we're just about the only people that they can deal with of size where we can commit that they are going to be part of this operation really forever and be able to deliver on that promise. I tell sellers that the only person that can double-cross them is me. I can double-cross them but there's never going to be a takeover of Berkshire. There's never going to be a management consultant come in and say I think you better do this. There's never going to be a response to Wall Street saying why aren't you a pure play on this or that and therefore you ought to spin this off it. None of that's going to happen and we can tell them with 100% assuredness that for a very long time that if they make a decision to come with Berkshire, that decision will be the final decision as to whether a company resides. Unless those conditions which are extremely unusual that are described in the ground rules prevail, we will not be selling operating businesses even though someone might offer far more than logically there were. The question about stocks is we're not quite with Phil Fisher on that but we're very close. We love buying stocks where we think the businesses are so solid. Have such economic advantage that we can essentially ride with them forever. But you've heard me talk about newspapers earlier today. We would have thought newspapers 20, 25 years ago, I think Charlie and I probably thought a daily newspaper and single newspaper town which is practically all are. Which probably about the solidest investment you could find. We might have thought a network TV affiliated station was about a solid as you could find and they were very solid. But events have over the last 20 or 25 years have certainly changed that to some degree and maybe to a very, very big degree. We will occasionally reevaluate the economic characteristics that we see 10 years out from the ones that we saw 10 years ago and maybe come to a somewhat different conclusion. The first 20 years of investing for me or maybe more, my decision to sell almost always was based on the fact that I found something else I was dying to buy. I mean I sold stocks at three times earnings to buy stocks at two times earnings 45 years ago because I was always running out of money. Now I run out of ideas. I've got a lot of money but no ideas. I'm not sure which is better. What do you think Charlie? I think you were way better off when you had 50 years ahead of you and less money. I still think I have 50 years ahead of me Charlie. You want to elaborate in broadselling? We almost never sell an operating business and when it does happen it's usually because we've got some trouble we can't fix."
"Apart from the catastrophic insurance events or Armageddon scenarios that you've been talking about earlier, in relation to the operations of Varkshire Hathaway, what are your greatest fears?","Well, the greatest, I would say, we don't worry about the economics of the businesses we have. We've got a very diverse group. Bionlargs are very good businesses. Bionlargs are run by some of the best managers in the country. But we worry about something going wrong. I mean, you know, you've heard about the Solomon thing in the movie, and I mean, we've got 180,000 people out there. And I'll guarantee you something is going wrong someplace. As we talk, that's just the nature of it. But what you hope is that it's relatively unimportant or that we catch it. But that's, you know, that is something that we know will happen. We try to have a culture that minimizes that. And I think we do have a culture that minimizes that. It's very important in our view to have the right incentives. And many places we think have incentives that aren't so good. I mean, when I get on an airplane, I think that's a very important thing. And incentives that aren't so good, I mean, when I get on an airplane, and we own the company like netchets, the last thing in the world I want to tell the pilot is that I'm running late. And I hope we can get to New York a little faster. I mean, that is dumb. To incentive pilot who may be worried, you know, somehow you affect his job or something to get in a hurry about the takeoff or the checklist or whatever it may be. Companies do that time after time in their compensation plans or things that they, they incent people in our view, at least, some of the wrong things. That doesn't mean nothing wrong will happen under any circumstances. But you should not have a system that causes people to, for example, worry about quarterly earnings. None of our managers do not submit budgets into all. Well, I have no idea what we're going to earn next quarter. And I have no implicit body language out there or anything of the sort to our managers that I'm hoping to earn x dollars per share in the quarter. Because in the insurance business particularly, you can report any numbers basically that you want to, if you write long tail business for a short period of time. And, you know, we've got 45 billion of loss reserves. Well, who knows whether the right figures 45 billion or 46 or 44. And if the desire is to report some given number in a given quarter, instead of saying 45 billion, you say 44 and 3.4 billion or something of the sort. So we have no incentives in terms of how people are paid or in terms of the fact they just don't want to let me down. Let's assume the start of the year I asked everybody to submit budgets and then I went out and Wall Street and breached a bunch of numbers. Even if they're compensationed and depend on it, the managers would feel, you know, we don't want to let more down on this. So, you know, we'll take an optimistic view of reserves. And that's easy to do at the end of the quarter and we won't let them down. And then he won't look like a jerk in front of Wall Street. So we try to avoid that sort of thing. But even then that is what we worry about. We don't worry about this place making money. I mean, we'll make money. And if we don't, it's my fault. And that's not the problem. The problem right now, in addition to the one we just talked about, the problem is deploying capital. And that's my job too. And I've done a very good job of that recently. But with a little luck, you know, we will, in a different kind of market situation, we will get a chance to do that. Charlie. Yeah. Well, you just have to think about it. The history of much of which we don't like in modern corporate capitalism comes from an unreasonable expectation communicated from headquarters that earnings have to go up with no volatility and great regularity, corporate earnings. I mean, that kind of an expectation from headquarters is not just the kissing cousin of evil. It's the blood brother of evil. And we just don't need that blood brother in our headquarters. Businesses do not meet expectations quarter after quarter and year after year. It just isn't in the nature of running businesses. And in our view, people that predict precisely what the future will be are either kidding investors or they're kidding themselves or they're getting both. And Charlie and I have been around culture sometimes on the board. Where the ego of the CEO became very involved in meeting predictions which were impossible really over time. And everybody in the organization knew, because they were very public about it, what these predictions were. And they knew that their CEO was going to look bad if they weren't met and that can lead to a lot of bad things. You get enough bad things anyway. But setting up a system that either exerts financial or psychological pressure on the people around you to do things that they probably really don't even want to do in order to avoid disappointing you. It's a terrible mistake and we'll try to avoid it."
"When you're valuing the companies and you discount back the future earnings you talked about, how many years out do you generally go? And if you don't go out a general number of years, how do you arrive at that time period?","Well, that's a very good question and it's the heart of investing or buying businesses which we regard as the same thing. And it is the framework in which we operate. I mean, we are trying to look at businesses in terms of what kind of cash can they produce if we're buying all of them or will they produce if we're buying part of them? And there's a difference. And then at what discount rate do we bring it back? And I think your question was how far out do we look at all that? Despite the fact that we can define that in a very simple and direct equation, we've never actually sat down and written out a set of numbers that to relate that equation. We do it in our heads in a way. Obviously, that's what it's all about. But there is no piece of paper. And there never was a piece of paper that shows what our calculation on Hell'sburg's or C's candy or the Buffalo news was in that respect. So it would be attaching a little more scientific quality to our analysis than there really is if I gave you some gobbledygook about while we do it for 18 years and just a terminal value on and do all of this. We are setting in the office thinking about that question with each business or each investment. And we have discount rates in a general way in mind. But we really like the decision to be obvious enough to us that it doesn't require making a detailed calculation. And it's the framework, but it's not applied in the sense that we actually fill in all the variables. Is that a fairway setting in terms of? Yeah. Berkure is being run the way Thomas Hunt Morgan, the great Nobel laureate, ran the biology department at Caltech. He banned the Frieden calculator, which was the computer of that era. And people said, how can you do this? Every place else in Caltech, we have Frieden calculators going everywhere. And he said, well, we're picking up these great nuggets of gold just by organized common sense. And resources are short. And we're not going to resort to any damn placer mining as long as we can pick up these major aggregations of gold. That's the way Berkure works. And I hope the placer mining era will never come. Somebody wants to pin-eat our staffing papers on some acquisition. And of course, not only did we not have any staffing papers, we didn't have any staff."
I've been a butcher shareholder since 1987 and always battling with the idea of what really is the intrinsic value for the company. We have seen that over time a change in book value is a vague indicator of the change in intrinsic value of birkshire. Although in absolute terms we have said again and again that intrinsic value in calculating the book value of birkshire our partly owned businesses like Coke and Gillette are valued at their market value. This component of book value fluctuates often irrationally depending on the mood of the market. Do you think that using a look through book value just like you use look through earnings is a superior measure for tracking changes in intrinsic value. In fact I had written a letter to you last August and I was very pleased to get a response from you personally saying that this approach makes sense. My question is does this approach really give you a better measure for tracking intrinsic value and if so would you consider publishing it in the annual report.,"Yeah thanks for the question. I would say that I'm not sure how you phrased it when you wrote me and how I phrased it going back but look through book value would not mean much actually the very best businesses, the really wonderful businesses require no book value. Yeah. They and we are we want to buy businesses really that will deliver more and more cash and not need to retain cash which is what builds up book value over time. Admittedly the prices of marketable securities at any given time are not a great indication of their intrinsic value. They are far better though than the book value of those companies in indicating intrinsic value. Berkshire's book, Berkshire's intrinsic value in a very general way and trends in it are better reflected in book value than is the case at a very high percentage of companies. It's still a very it's not it's not a great proxy. It's the best it's a it's a proxy that is useful in terms of direction in terms of in terms of degree in a general way over time but it's it's not a substitute for intrinsic value. In our case when we started with Berkshire intrinsic value was below book value. Our company was not worth book value in 1960 early 1965. You could not have sold the assets for that price that they were carried on the books you could not have no one could make a calculation in terms of future cash flows that wouldn't indicate that those assets were worth their carrying value. Now it is true that our businesses are worth a great deal more than book value and that's occurred gradually over time so obviously there are a number of years when our intrinsic value grew greater than our book value to get where we are today. Book value is not a bad starting point in the case of Berkshire as far from the finishing point. It's no starting point at all of any kind in in you know whether it's the Washington Post or or or or or or or or Gillette it's a factor we ignore. We do look at what the company is able to earn on invested assets and what it can earn on incremental invested assets but the book value we do not give a thought to"
"Like many people around the world who want to learn about business, I've read all of your letters to the shareholders, and like many people here in this room, I was so impressed that I bought a piece of the company. But I must admit that in studying Berkshire Hathaway, there's one element that I didn't quite understand, and I'd love it if you could please explain it. And that is the following. How does Berkshire Hathaway add value to the various wholly owned companies in the manufacturing services and retail division? And the reason I asked this question is, as you yourself said earlier this morning, it's very difficult in negotiating purchase agreement to buy a company for anything other than what it's truly worth. So if Berkshire Hathaway is going to create value by buying such fantastic companies, as Nebraska furniture, mar, seas, candies, or any of the other fantastic businesses we have, there must be some. Maybe some way in which Berkshire Hathaway adds to that value. Could you please explain how we do that?","In certain specific cases, in case of General Ray being the most recent example, we actually laid out in the proxy material why we thought there was at least a reasonable chance that the ownership by Berkshire would add value, and we got into various reasons about the ability to use the float and tax advantage and the ability to move faster around the world and that sort of thing. So we've actually spelled that out in that case. I think in the case of something like executive jet, you might well figure that there are some reasons why association with Berkshire would put executive jet on the map and in the minds of people who could afford to buy fractional ownership of planes faster than might otherwise be the case. But usually the situation, so there are specific cases where we bring something to the party. But the biggest thing we bring to the party on a generalize basis is what I spelled out a little bit in the annual report this year and talking about Geico. We enable terrific managers to spend many cases to spend a greater percentage of their time and energies on what they do best and what they like to do best and what is the most productive for owners, then would be the case without our ownership. In other words, we give them a very rational owner who expects them to spend all of their time focused on what counts for the business and eliminates the distractions that often come with running a business, particularly a publicly owned business. I would guess that the CEO's of most public companies waste the third of their time, at least in all kinds of things they do that really don't add a thing to the business. In many cases subtract because they're trying to please various constituencies and waste their time with them that take the company backwards. But we eliminate all of that. We simply can create an ownership, we think we can create the best ownership of environment frankly that can exist other than maybe owning it 100% yourself for any business. That happens to also go along with how we like to lead our lives because we don't want to run around and attend a lot of meetings and do all of these things that people do. That can be a significant plus, I think that Geico is probably growing a fair amount faster as a subsidiary of Berkshire than it would have if it remained an independent company, although it was a hell of an independent company and would have continued to be one. But I think billions and billions of dollars will be added to the value of Geico over and above what would have happened if it had remained a public company. Not because as I put in the report, we haven't taught the management one thing about the classification of insurance risk or how to run better ads or anything of the sort. We just let them spend 100% of their time focused on what counts and that is a rare occurrence in American business. Charlie? Yeah, just not having a vast headquarters staff to tell a subsidiary is what to do. That helps most of the kind of subsidiaries that we buy. They are not looking for a lot of people looking over their shoulder from headquarters and a lot of unnecessary flights back and forth and so on. I would say most of what we do, or at least a great part of what we do, is just not interfere in a counterproductive way. That non-interference has enormous value, at least with the kind of managers and the kind of businesses, but have joined us. You have to see it to believe it, but in a great many corporate operations, the important importance of a large group of people is tied down much, they meddle in the affairs of other people who are out there doing the work. We stay out of the way and we are appreciative owners and we are knowledgeable owners. We know when somebody has done a good job and we know when they have done a good job when industry conditions are terribly tough. We can look at our shoe operations, for example, and they are in tough industry conditions. Now we have some absolutely terrific people and we are knowledgeable enough about that. So that we don't go simply by a bunch of figures and make a determination whether people are doing the right thing. We are knowledgeable owners and we have no one whose job at headquarters is to go around and tell our managers how to run their human relations departments or how to run their legal departments or other things. Not only do people have more time to work on the productive things, but I think they probably actually appreciate the fact that they are left alone. So I think you even get more than the proportional amount of effort out of them than would be indicated simply by the amount of time you are free up because I think you get an even an added enthusiasm for the job. And I think having people on a large organization that truly are enthusiastic about what they are doing, that doesn't happen all the time. I think it does happen to a pretty good degree of virtue."
Would you please revisit the question of share repurchase for Brookshire Hathaway? We have heard today your comment about the price of Brookshire having been inefficiently priced from time to time in the past. We know that there are now more shares outstanding. And I'm curious as to whether the build up of cash is causing you to spend more time looking for investment situations where you're more comfortable on the 10 year outlook.,The question of repurchasing shares and I made that comment about it being inefficiently priced at times. At those times it always seemed us and we were incorrect in some cases. It always seemed us that there were other securities that were even less efficiently priced. When Brookshire in 1974 sold at $50 a share I might have thought it was cheap but I also was looking at the whole Washington Post Company selling for 80 million when I thought it was clearly worth 400 million and I did not think that Brookshire was as underpriced then as the Washington Post Company was. And that has been true at various times when there have been times when I thought Brookshire has been underpriced or even significantly under price but at the same time I was finding other things which I felt were even more attractive. And like I say many times I was wrong. We would have been better off buying our own stock instead of buying the things that I was buying. But the if we have money around and we think Brookshire is significantly underpriced and we're not finding other things to do with money it obviously makes sense for us to repurchase Brookshire shares. I think it's difficult for most companies in this market even though repurchases are probably close to an all-time high if not an all-time high. I think it's difficult for most companies to be repurchasing have it repurchase of shares make a whole lot of sense these days. I mean I do not think they are getting much for their money because we don't want to buy those shares ourselves and it's a thumb out of stock of various companies in America. And yet companies are much more enthusiastic about repurchasing shares now than they were 20 years ago when they were getting far far greater returns from repurchasing. We will always it's an option that we will always think about and we're unlikely to do it unless we think it's fairly dramatically underpriced because it's simply we would want a big margin for error and making that kind of a decision that we would not want to buy a dollar bill for 95 cents or 94 cents or 93 cents but there is some level where we would start getting excited if we didn't have other uses for the money.
"I have a question about intrinsic value. It comes from comments that you made in your annual report this year. In there, you describe the extraordinary skills of a jet in judging risk. When I think about Berkshire and its ability to increase intrinsic value, it seems to me that judging risk has been at least as important as an ability to calculate a net present value. So my question to each of you is, would you give us some comments on how you think about risk?","Well, we think of business risk in terms of what can happen, say, 5, 10, 15 years from now that will destroy or modify or reduce the economic strengths that we perceive currently exist in a business. And some businesses, that's very impossible to figure, at least it's impossible for us to figure. And then we just, we don't even think about it then. We are enormously risk averse. We are not risk averse in terms of losing a billion dollars if there were an earthquake in California today. And we are thinking of writing a policy, for example, in the next week or so on a primary insurance risk of over a billion dollars. Well, that doesn't bother us as long as the math is in our favor. But in terms of doing a group of transactions like that, we are very risk averse. In other words, we want to think that we've got a mathematical edge in every transaction. And we think that we'll do enough transactions over a lifetime so that no matter what the result of any single one, that the group expectancy gets almost a certainty. When we look at businesses, we try to think of what can go wrong with them. We try to look at businesses that are good businesses now. And we think about working go wrong with them. If we can think of very much that can go wrong with them, we just forget it. We are not in the business of assuming a lot of risk in businesses. And that doesn't mean we don't do it inadvertently and make mistakes because we do. But we don't intentionally or willingly, voluntarily go in to situations where we perceive really significant risks that the business is going to change in a major way. And that gets down to what you probably heard me talk about before is what kind of a moat is around the business. Every business that we look at, we think of as an economic castle. And castles are subject to marauders. And in capitalism, any castle you have, whether it's razor blades or soft drinks or whatever, you have to expect that. And you want the capitalist system to work in a way that millions of people are out there with capital thinking about ways to take your castle away from you and appropriate it for their own use. And then the question is, what kind of a moat do you have around that castle that protects it? See, he's candy has a wonderful moat around its castle. And Chuck Huggins has taken that moat which he took charge of in 1972. And he is widened that moat every year. He throws crocodiles and sharks and piranhas in the moat and gets harder and harder for people to swim across and attack the castle so they don't do it. If you look since 1972, Forest Mars tried with FOM, I don't know, 20 years ago. And I hate to think about how much money it costs him to try that. And he was a very experienced businessman. So we think of the, we think in terms of that moat and the ability to keep its width and its impossibility of being crossed as the primary criterion of a great business. And to our managers, we say we want the moat widened every year. You know, that does not necessarily mean that the profit is more this year than last year because it won't be sometimes. But the moat is widened every year, the business will do very well. When we don't have, when we, when we see a moat that's tenuous in any way, it's getting back to your question, it's, it's just too risky. We don't, we don't know how to evaluate that. And therefore we leave it alone. We think all of our businesses, virtually all of our businesses have pretty darn good moats and we think the managers are widening them."
Book you read,"oh books I've read tell them what books you read Charlie Well, I mentioned that one book Genome I have a hell of a time putting the accent on the first syllable but that is a marvelous book and Some shareholders sent me a book that not many of you will like by Herb Simon I think Models of my life And that's a very interesting book or a certain academic type But that genome which is the history of a species and 23 chapters and It's a perfectly amazing book and very interesting I may have recommended it before but if you haven't read personal history by Catherine Graham I think you'd find it's a fascinating story and and the more amazing yet. It's an honest story You know if I ever write my autobiography. I'm gonna look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but But she is compulsively honest about what's happened and it's really quite a saga. It is a good book That geno low book about me I find has had a very interesting Subchapter so to speak in its distribution. I notice a considerable number of people buying that book and sending one copy to each descendant They believe that if they just do that The descendants will behave more like the parents It'll be interesting to see if that works if it does it's going to outsell the Bible hold your breath though"
My question is related to the issue of US trade deficit again and its implications on the future value of the dollar. Do you think an individual or a business owner here in US should be concerned about the purchasing power of his future dollar earnings or savings and diversify his or her investments in non-dollar-based securities?,"I think it's very tough for individuals to either select individual stocks, select individual times to enter the market, select currencies. But I just think that's a game that they tend to get interested in at the wrong time. There's some adverse selection in terms of when people who do not follow stocks carefully get interested in stocks. I think that the best investment you can have for most people is in your own abilities. I mean, when I talk to students, I would pay a student. In many cases, I would be glad to pay them $100,000 for cash upfront for 10% of all their future earnings. So I'm willing to pay $100,000 for 10% of them. I'm valuing the whole person at a million dollars, just capital value standing there in front of me. And anything you do to develop your own abilities is probably going to be or your own business is probably going to be more productive for you than starting to think about individually making commitments into foreign exchange. And if you have a good business in this country earning money in dollars, you'll do okay. I mean, you may live in a world 20 years from now where a couple percent of the GDP is going to service the debts and the ownership that we've created now by running these deficits. But you'll do fine in America. So I wouldn't worry about that much. Charlie. If you look at Berkshire, you will find that it really doesn't do much of conventional asset allocation to categories. We are looking for opportunities and we don't much care what category they're in. And we certainly don't want to have our search for opportunities governed by some predetermined artificial bunch of categories. In this sense, we're totally out of step with modern investment management, but we think they're wrong. Yeah. And incidentally, we we have 80% of our money or more well over 80% tied to tied to this country into the dollar. So it's it's it's not like, you know, we've left the country or anything of the sort. When have you done a big asset allocation strategy? Never. Yeah. Yeah. We end up with the killer asset mixes. I mean, if the junk bond thing had gone on a little longer instead of having seven billion in there, we might have had 30 billion in. But we were doing that simply based on the fact that it was screaming at us. And we do the same thing with equities. I mean, back for many years, we had more than the net worth of a Berkshire in equity positions. We're cheap. And I want you to remember one of my favorite sayings as you do this asset allocation. If a thing's not worth it doing it all, it's not worth doing well."
"My question is, does the book buff etology by Mary Buffett resent fairly in all material respects the calculations you used in evaluating the business for purchase or the lady just write a book?","Well, it was written by two authors. But I would say that, no, I would say that in a general way, it gets at the investment philosophy, but I wouldn't say that it's not the book I would have written precisely, but I have no coral with it either. I actually think by reading Berkshire's reports, you should be able to get more, I would think you get more of our philosophy than any other matter. I think Larry Cunningham, the fellow held the symposium at the Cardoso School at Yashiva, did the best job actually of sort of reconstructing the various things that have been written at Berkshire into sort of the best organized presentation of our philosophy. So he's selling it right here. It's a very practical. Yeah, I had it in the mall outside, Borschein yesterday, and Larry did a very good job, and I had nothing to do with it, but I think that I really think he's done a first-class job of sort of organizing my topic. I mean, all these things that I've sort of written annually and Charlie's written over time. So that would probably be my, if I were picking one thing to read, that would probably be the one."
"With reference to communication stocks, a course of the growth of cellular communications and the internet, certain stocks hold the prospect of substantially above average revenue and earnings growth. AT&T and Nokia, as an example, earn respectable margins and return on common equity and would seem to fit Berkshire's criteria from a financial perspective. As Berkshire reviewed stocks in the area of communications, would you consider an investment in this area at some time in the future?","There's certainly no question. Amazing things have happened in communications. It's interesting that you mentioned AT&T because AT&T's return on equity over the last 15 years has been very, very poor. They have had special charges time after time and said, don't count this. But the overall return on equity, if you calculated for AT&T for the last 15 years, it's not been good at all. They were the leader in the field, but so far what has happened is has hurt them, at least relative to their competition far more than it's helped them. We have a fellow on our board, Walter Scott, who is right here in the front row, if I can quite see him. But Munger knows a lot more about this. He used to try to explain to me these changes that were taking place. We'd ride down a football game on Saturday. And Walter would patiently explain to me like he was talking to a sixth grader what was going to happen in communications. And the problem was that he had a fourth grader in the car with him, namely me. So I never got it, but Walter did. And he's done very well in MFS and level three. And I think for people who understand it, and are reasonably early, you know, there could very well be substantial money to be made. There's been an awful lot of money made in this town of Omaha by people, not one of them. And I have no insights that I bring to that game that I think are in any way superior. And probably in many cases, not even equal to those of other participants. There's a lot of difference between making money and spotting a wonderful industry. You know, the two most important industries in the first half of the century in the United States, in the world, probably with the auto industry and the airplane industry. I mean, here are these two discoveries, both in the first decade, essentially in the first decade of the century. And if you've foreseen in 1905 or thereabouts what the auto would do to the world, a little on the or this country or what the airplane would do, you might have thought that it was a great way to get rich, but very, very few people got rich by being, by writing the back of that auto industry. And probably even fewer got rich by participating in the airline industry over that time. I mean, millions of people are flying around every day, but the number of people who made money carrying them around is very limited. And that the capital has been lost in that business, the bankruptcy, it's been a terrible business. It's been a marvelous industry. So you do not want to necessarily equate the prospects of growth for an industry with the prospects for growth in your own net worth by participating in it, Charlie. Oh, it reminds me of a time in World War II, when these two aircraft officers I knew and I didn't have anything to do at the time. So I'm general came into visit and he said to one of them, he says, the tenant Jones, what do you do? He says, I don't do anything. He turned to the second one, he says, what do you do? And he says, I help the tenant Jones. That's been my contribution on communications investments. You're going to address me as Lieutenant Jones for the rest of the meeting at the moment."
You have discussed what a wonderful business is. One of the criteria in your acquisition page 23 of your annual report is management. Could you discuss how you decide what good management is and how you decide whether you have a good manager?,"The really great business is one that doesn't require good management. I mean that is that's a terrific business. And the poor business is one that can only succeed or even survive with great management. But we look for people that know their businesses, love their businesses, love their shareholders, want to treat them as partners. And we still look to the underlying business. If we have somebody that we think is extraordinary, but they're locked into one of those terrible businesses, because we've been in subterrible businesses. And the best thing you can do probably is get out of it and get into something else. But there's an enormous difference, frankly. There's an enormous difference in the talent of American business managers. The CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not selected like 500 members of the American Olympic track and field team. And it is not the same process. And you do not have the uniformity of top quality that you get with the American Olympic team. In any sport, you do not get that in top management in American business. You get some very able people, some terrific people like Bill Gates that we just mentioned. But you get a lot of mediocrity too. And the test, I think in some cases that it's fairly identifiable who has done an extraordinary job. And we like people that have batted 350 or 360 in terms of predicting that they're going to battle over 300 in the future. And some guy says, you know, I batted 127 last year, but I've got a new batter, a new batting coach, you know, some management consultants come in and told them how to do it supposedly. We're very suspicious of that. So we don't, we don't like banjo hitters as suddenly proclaim that they can become power hitters. And then we try to figure out what their attitude is towards shareholders. And that isn't uniform, either throughout corporate America, it's far from uniform. We still want them to be in a good business. So I would emphasize that. And we feel that, I mean, when I gave the illustration of Tom Murphy in the, in the annual report, I mean, no one had either the ability, no one could top his ability or, or integrity in terms of the way he ran cap cities for decades. I mean, and you could, you could see it in 50 different ways. I mean, he was thinking about the shareholders and he not only thought about, I mean, you know what to do to forward their interests. And in terms of building the business, he only built it when it made sense, not when it did something for his, his ego or make it larger alone. He did it when it was in his shareholders interests. And they're, they're not all Tom Murphy's, but when you find him and they're in a decent business, you want to bet very heavily and not make the same mistake I made by selling out once or twice too."
"My question is about compensation, and I've seen your writing and I heard the earlier comments today, and they still leave me as a guy who is a business owner, not quite sure how to act to design compensation for managers. For most of my career, I've been the senior manager in my businesses, but now I'm in a situation where I'm looking to own a majority interest of businesses that I don't manage every day directly, and I'm very concerned with this compensation issue. I think about things like return on equity or growth or risk or like that, but if you could speak a little more towards the specific of how you approach the getting it to the right things to measure and in-cent, I'd appreciate that.","It's a very good question, and there is no formula that applies across all industries or businesses. If you pay way too much for the business that you buy, the person who runs it's going to get a lot of return on your equity. They may get a good return on the tangible assets employed in the business, but your purchase price may defeat them in terms of earning good returns. If you're based on earnings on tangible equity, there are businesses like a network television station where if you have an idiot nephew, you can put them in charge and learn huge returns on equity as long as they manage to stay away from the office. There are other businesses where you have to be a genius, turn, 7 or 8% returns on equity. There is no single yard sink to have a fair compensation system. Both you and the manager have to really understand the economics of the business. In some businesses, the amount of capital employed is all important. In some businesses, the amount of capital employed doesn't mean anything. We have certain businesses where we have charges for capital and all of that, and where we have other businesses where that would just be an exercise to go through and it wouldn't really change any results. Anyway, we have a great preference for making them simple. We concentrate on the variables that count to us, and then we try to put that against the backdrop of the competitive nature of the true economics of the business that are in and really reward where they're adding value, even if that value is from a very low base in a lousy business. We make it the base very high if they're in a very easy business. It hasn't been a problem, but I would say it would have been an enormous problem if we'd brought in some compensation consultants because they would have wanted something that was spread across the whole group and it would have had all kinds of variables. They particularly would have wanted something that they would have had to come in every year and redo in some way so that they would have had a continuing stream of income. If I knew what kind of a business you were looking at, it's easier to talk about what kind of a system to have. If you had a group of television stations to pick an example, let's say they were network television stations, all of a reasonable size, and you would probably figure that a chimpanzee could run the place. You would have 35% pre-tax margins and you might want to pay for performance above some number like that. It's silly to have something that starts at 10% or 15% when you do that. An lousy manager will always suggest an arrangement like that. Charlie and I've seen all kinds of compensation arrangements where basically you get paid for showing up but they try to make it look by constructing some mathematics around it like you really had to achieve something. In the end, if you get a great manager, you want to pay them very well. We've got great managers, for example, to a place like Mid-American and somebody mentioned that there's a big carrot out there for them if they achieve the results that we've set out. That will be a check. I'll be very happy to write. Charlie, if you want to read one book that will demonstrate really shrewd compensation systems in a whole chain of small businesses, read the autobiography of Les Schwab, who had a bunch of tire shops, has a bunch of tire shops all over the Northwest and he made a huge fortune on one of the world's really difficult businesses by having shrewd systems and he can tell you a lot better than we can. Yeah, and he worked that out himself. It's an interesting book and selling tires. How do you make any money doing that? Hundreds of millions selling tires. People like Sam Walton, the compensation system, I will guarantee you at Walmart or Charlie's in Balvin, Costco, they're going to be rational because you had very rational people running them. They wanted to get the best, they wanted to track good managers and they wanted to get the best out of them and they had no use in paying for mediocrity. But that does require a knowledge of the business. You don't want to let, if you don't understand a business, you're going to have a problem with both the manager and the consultant in terms of getting flimplammed on how you pay people."
Can you describe how you made your investment decision to invest in a Heizer Bush and how you estimated its intrinsic value? How long did it take you to make this decision and is fertilizer an inevitable like Coca-Cola?,"I'm still breaking a Coca-Cola. Well, the meeting might get a little exciting if we were drinking but here. We don't get into much in the way of description of things we might be buying or selling. But the decision takes about two seconds. But I bought 100 shares of Aniser about, I looked it up. But I would say maybe 25 years ago, when I bought 100 shares of a whole lot of other things. And I do that so I can get the reports promptly and directly. You can get them for your brokerage firm, but I found it's a little more reliable to put the stock in a direct name. So I've been reading the reports for at least 25 years and I observe just generally consumer habits. And at a point, currently, the beer industry sales are very flat. Wine and spirits have gained in that general category at the expensive beer. So if you look at the industry figures, they're not going anywhere. Millers has been rejuvenated to some degree. So Aniser, which has had a string of earnings gains that have been quite substantial over the years and market share gains is experiencing as they've described. And they just had a conference call the other day. Experiencing very flat earnings, having to spend more money to maintain share in some cases, having promotional pricing. So they are going through a period that certainly less fun for them than was the case a few years ago. And it's a fairly easy to understand product and consumer behaviors fairly easy to understand. It's a very, very exceptionally strong business. In fact, what's happened in the beer industry over the last 50 years has been fascinating to me and to Charlie because this is a brewing town that we grew up in and Charlie knew the members of the store's family number of them well. The stores had over 50% of the Omaha market in beer post-World War II and basically disappeared as the National Brands took over. So it's an interesting phenomenon. Beer business is not going to grow significantly in the US. Worldwide, barris popular, great many places. And Aniser will have a very strong position in it. But I would not expect the earnings to do much for some time. But that's fine with us, Charlie. Yeah, at our scale of operation now, if we're ever going to buy into a terribly well-regarded company, we almost need a little patch of unpleasantness. Yeah. That's been the best time to buy Berkshire incidentally, too. I mean, what we're looking for is businesses with a durable competitive advantage. I don't think there's any question that Aniser has a very, very strong consumer position. Now, as I said, Miller has been rejuvenated to some degree. But the other thing about it is, of course, in beer, you do not see the prevalence of private labels or generic products that you see in a great many consumer products that are being, that have had strong positions over the years that are being attacked. That's a small plus. But beer consumption per capita is going no place. And there's nothing that will change that. Interestingly enough, the average person in this climate drinks about 64 ounces of liquid a year. And I think it's roughly 27% of that will be carbonated soft drinks. So almost. And of course, that Coca-Cola will be about Coca-Cola products will be 40 odd percent. So of the 64 ounces of liquid that Americans are drinking every day, you can figure something like 11 ounces of that man, woman, and child will be a Coca-Cola product. Beer, as I remember, I could be wrong on this. But I think beer is about 10% of all liquids. So one out of every 10 ounces of that's consumed by Americans of any kind of liquid is I believe is beer. Coffee incidentally, despite what you read about, you know, the popularity of Starbucks, which is very real, of course. But coffee has just gone down and down and down over the last 30 or 40 years. Charlie, do you have any thoughts about your consumption habits? That's your can talk about. Well, there are people here that may remember Metz beer. And in this country, we had more breweries. There were hundreds. And small places would have two or three brands. And this trend toward concentration into a few chances, I think, permanent. Yes, Schlitz was number one, as I remember, after World War Two for a while. I think Anisah was number four at that time. There's an interesting book. If you're a beer enthusiast, came out a few months ago, maybe a little longer than that by a Wall Street Journal reporter that sort of toured the country, sampling beers. I don't know how it affected his writing. But it's a pretty good book. If you like reading about the history of beer"
"If you have any more like a jeet of their tandem, we need them. Right. My question pertains to the allocation of a company's free cash. And the question is, under what circumstances would Berkshire consider parting with its money for a shared buyback program as opposed to retaining it for future acquisitions?","Yeah, that's a good question. And we addressed that a bit back a couple of years ago. In fact, I think our annual report for 1999 came out on March 12th. I believe it was March 12th on a Friday or night or a Saturday morning. That was the day. The NASDAQ had its high and Berkshire hit its low on the exact day. And we said we would next morning on the internet on a Saturday morning. We said we would repurchase, but we wanted you to have the annual report first, but we would repert. We might repurchase at those levels. And the NASDAQ never saw its level of 51 hundred again. And Berkshire never saw its level of whatever it was, 41,000 or thereabouts. Our preference, and we say that this 20 years ago, even is to buy businesses. We want to add businesses of a quality with managers of a quality equal to those we already own at prices that make sense. And that's our number one preference. If we thought Berkshire was significantly undervalued and we thought the likelihood of using the money to buy businesses, the probability was low. We would be buying stock in. We probably wouldn't be able to buy a lot of stock in, but we would only buy stock in if we thought the stock was selling significantly below intrinsic value. And there's no magic figure for intrinsic value. And intrinsic value is a range. Charlie would name a different number than I would name, but our ranges would be quite similar if we were to write them down on a piece of paper now, but they wouldn't be identical. So we would leave a significant margin of safety and want to buy a what would be a clear cut to us discount from the lower levels of intrinsic value we might calculate. It's not our number one preference to be on. We would rather add business. We love it when we add good businesses to Berkshire. But we would have to stock. We could add in intrinsic value per share by repurchasing. And we'd given all the shareholders relevant information about the values so that we weren't putting anything over on them that they had the same information we had. We would buy in stock. I think it's unlikely that happens that we don't find other opportunities to do things at a time like that, but it could happen. And it almost happened in March of 2000. And then things should surround very, very abruptly."
I'm very curious about the Buffett-Monger philosophy and practice of philanthropy.,"Charlie, you want to swing at that one first? I think it's fair to say that both of us feel that the very fortunate, oh, a duty to the general civilization, not even to the country of which he, he's a member, whether you give as you go along or have the Buffett system of moderate giving as you go along and immense giving, in due course, I rematter a regard as a matter of personal taste. I would understand the second position in that I would hate to spend all my time every day having people ask me for money, and I don't think Warren could stand it. Let's not even try, let's not even try, Charlie. Oh wait, I mean, it's a matter of record and hasn't changed for, I don't know, 25 years probably, but basically everything I have at the date of the later of the death of myself or my wife goes to charity. I mean, 99 and a significant fraction, and since my children are here, I'm not going to carry it out. They ate decimal places, but they, they don't, why not? Think about this way, here, here, here, here, let's just assume that instead of being born as I was in a single birth, that I were in the womb, and there was an identical twin next to me, same DNA, same, everything, personality, propensity to work, propensity to say, whatever, identical twin, wasn't Charlie, it might look like him, but, and there we are, the tulips, and a genie appeared. And the genie said, I've got a proposition for the two of you, you're going to be born in 24 hours, same talents, everything identical. And one of you is going to be born in Omaha, and one of you is going to be born in Bangladesh. And I'm going to let you two decide which one gets to be born in Bangladesh, and which one gets to be born in Omaha. And I've got this system, and I'm what, the way I'm going to work it is that you, we start the bidding, and whichever one of you bids the highest proportion of your state to go to society, when you die, gets to go be born in the United States. I think you've been 100%. You know, you hear all of this about, you know, grit and pluck and all of these things, and how, you know, you've applied yourself working all your life, and you've done all these wonderful things. Well, just imagine if I've been born in Bangladesh, you know, and I walked down Main Street and said, you know, I, I allocate capital, you know, let me show my stuff, and I, I'd have died of malnutrition. I mean, I wouldn't have made it through the first few months. The society, the Charlie and I working, I mean, we were lucky, and how, I mean, when we were born, the odds were 50 to one against us being born in the United States. So we hit the jackpot. And basically, you know, we've had all of the fun of working with us and working with good people and money obviously, it opens lots of doors and life to interesting things. And it goes back to society like Charlie says, you can go back on the installment system through life, I can go back and alums some at death. I've mixed the two, the sum extent, but I, I wait heavily, the lump sum. But, you know, that's where it belongs. I mean, it, there's no reason why little generations of little buffets now, and the next one, you know, 100 years from now, should all be commanding the resources of society just because they came out of the right womb. You know, what sort of justice is that? So, so basically, it's going back to society."
"I was talking to one of the former managers of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, Managed Huge Amounts of Money, and he never really met you. And I was saying, I may have a chance to ask Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger a question. What would that question be? I wanted to have some idea of something intelligent I could ask business-wise. And he thought, if he had the opportunity to talk to you, the best thing is to give you what would sound like a softball question, because you could maybe bring more profoundness to this than we hear usually. In view of the Iraq War, consumer debt that's increasing, declining job growth, declining pay in the jobs that are growing, prospects of increased interest rates, he has this view that the next five to ten years are going to be very difficult. What would your view be about the investment future for the next five to ten years, and do you have all these negative factors going on?","That's too soft for me, I think Warren should think about it. Well, I would say that at any given point in history, including one's stocks were their cheapest, you could find an equally impressive number of negative factors. I mean, you could have sat down in 1974 when stocks were screaming bargains, and you could have written down all kinds of things that would have caused you to say the future is just going to be terrible. And similarly, at the top, or anytime you can write down a large list of things that would be quite on the bully side, we really don't pay any attention to that sort of thing. I mean, we have, you might say that our underlying premise, and I think it's a pretty sound underlying premise, is that this country will do very well, and in particularity, it will do well for business. Business has done very well. The Dow went from 66 to 10,000 plus in the hundred years of the 20th century, and we had two world wars and nuclear bombs and flu epidemics, and you name it, Cold War. There's always problems in the future. There are always opportunities in the future, and in this country, the opportunities have won out over the problems over time. And I think they will continue to do so, absent weapons of master's destruction, which is another question, and business won't make much difference if anything really drastically happens along that line. So, we don't, I don't, I can't remember many discussions Charlie that I've had ever going back to 1959, where we would have come to the conclusion at the end of them that we would have passed on a great business opportunity, a business to buy because of external conditions, and we thought it was mediocre, simply because we thought the world was going to be wonderful. It won't be the American economy, in my view, that doesn't invest over a five or ten or twenty year period. It will be the investors themselves. If you look at the record of the 20th century, you'd say, how could anybody have missed, you know, and owning equities during that time, and yet, you know, we had, we had all kinds of people wiped out, you know, in the 29th, 32th period, we had all kinds of things that were bad, but if you would just own stocks right straight through, didn't leverage them, you know, you would, you know, you'd have gotten a perfectly decent return. So, we're, we're unaffected in essence by the, by the variables you mentioned, just show us a good business tomorrow and we'll jump at the hook, Charlie. Yeah, I think, but it's also true that both of us have said it various times over the last three years that we wouldn't be at all surprised if professionally invested money in America. I had a pretty modest result over a fairly extended period of the future compared to the very dramatic way, high returns that it had achieved up to about three years ago. And so far, that's been proved out to be pretty much right. Yeah. Certain stretches are easier than other stretches. Yeah, our expectations were, were more modest than most people, so two years ago, we didn't say the world was coming to the end or anything, we just said that people had gone crazy in certain sectors and that, and that anybody that thought that, that you could, you know, sit at home and day trade and make double digit returns over time or do anything with it, you were entitled to that, you know, by just sticking a little money in your 401k or something, was really living in a fool's paradise. But that was never accompanied by any predictions of disaster for the American economy as a whole or from American businesses. It's, people get crazy notions from time to time in financial markets and we've come in on this earlier but they just believe things that there's, it's hard to understand how they can believe. Now, since I'm a student, they get sold that by other people. But American business really is, is never let investors down or to a group, but investors have done themselves in quite frequently."
You've often stated that value and growth are opposite sides of the same coin Would you care to elaborate on that and do you prefer a growth company that is selling cheap or a value company with with moderate Or better growth process?,"Well actually, I think you're maybe misquoting me, but I really said that growth and value They're indistinguishable. They're part of the same equation or really growth is part of the value equation So there are position is that there is no such thing as as growth stocks or value stocks the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes growth usually as a chance to Growth usually is a positive for value, but only when the It it it means that by adding capital now you add more Cash availability later on at a rate that's considerably higher than the current rate of interest so There is no we don't we We calculate in that any business we buy what we expect to have happen in terms of the cash that's going to come out of it Or the cash that's going to go into it as I mentioned at flight safety We're going to buy 200 million dollars worth of simulators this year our depreciation will probably be in the area of 70 million dollars are thereabouts, so we're putting 130 million dollars Above depreciation into that business now that can be good or bad. I mean it's growth. There's no question about it We'll have a lot more simulators at the end of the year, but whether that's good or bad depends on what we earn on that incremental 130 million dollars over time so if you tell me that That you own a business that's going to grow to the sky and isn't that wonderful? I don't know whether it's wonderful or not until I know what What the economics are of Of that growth how much you have to put in today and how much you will reap from putting that in today later on and the classic case again Is the airline business the airline business has been a growth business ever since well, you know that or will took off But it's the growth has been the worst thing that happened to it. It's been great for the American public but growth has been a curse in the in the airline business because more and more capital has been put into the business in adequate returns Now growth is wonderful. It sees candy because it requires relatively little like incremental investment To sell more pounds of candy so it's growth and I've discussed this in some of the annual reports growth is Part of the equation, but anybody that tells you you out of your money and gross stocks or values stocks really does not understand investing Other than that they're terrific people Charlie Well, I think it's fair to say that Berkshire with a very limited Headquarters staff and that staff pretty old we are especially partial to Blaying out large sums of money under circumstances where we won't have to be smart again In other words if we buy good businesses run by good people at reasonable prices There's a good chance that you people will prosper us for many Decades without more intelligence at headquarters and You can say in a sense that's growth stock investing Yeah, if you'd asked Wall Street to classify Berkshire since 1965 year by year is this a gross business or value business Growth stock or value stock, you know who knows what they would have said but You know the real point is that we're trying to put out capital now to get more capital or Money it we're trying to put out cash now to get more cash back later on and If you do that the business grows obviously and you can call that value or you can call it growth but but they're not two different categories and I just cringe When I when I hear people talk about now it's time to move from gross stocks to value stocks or something like that Because it just doesn't make any sense"
"With Berkshire's size becoming very large, I would expect major future investments to be in the form of complete buyouts, such as the general re-equivision, or would you still consider nibbling in the stock market?","My name is Fred Costano from East Point, Michigan, and I appreciate this opportunity. Well, we don't want to nibble, but we would like to take big gulps in the stock market from time to time. But we've always wanted to acquire entire businesses. People never seem to really believe that back when we were buying C's candy or the Buffalo News or National Indemity. That's been our number one preference right along. It's just that we found that much of the time we could get far more for our money in terms of wonderful businesses by buying pieces in the stock market than we could by negotiated purchase. There may have been, there may be some movement in terms of the availability of the two toward the negotiated purchase. Although it's almost impossible to make a wonderful buy in a negotiated purchase. I mean, you will never make the kind of buy in a negotiated purchase that you can in a bad style that you can make by a stock in a weak stock market. It just isn't going to happen. The person on the other side cares too much, whereas in the stock market in a 1973 or four, you were dealing with the marginal seller and whatever price they established for the business, you could buy it. I couldn't have bought the entire Washington Post Company for $80 million in 1974, but I could buy 10% of it from a bunch of people who were just operating based on calculating betas or doing something of a sort. They were in a terrible market and it was possible to buy a piece of it on that valuation. You never get that kind of buy in a negotiated purchase. We always are more interested in a negotiated, large negotiated deals than we are in stock purchases, but we are not going to find a way probably to use all the money that way. We occasionally make a chance to put big chunks of money into attractive businesses that are which we buy through the stock market, 5-10% of the company or something of that sort. Charlie? My guess is over the next five years we'll do some of both. Both the entire business and the big gulps in the stock market. I agree with that. We'll keep working at both. We're not finding a lot in either arena. We might be a little more likely to find it in the negotiated business. It won't be any huge bargain. We're not going to get any huge bargain in the negotiated purchase. We are more likely to find what I would call a fair deal. They're under today's circumstances than we will in the market, but I agree with Charlie. We'll next five years. I think you'll see us do both."
"A few years ago, you said you had made a mistake by not buying shares of the major pharmaceutical companies around 1993. You cited their value to society, as well as their terrific growth, high-profit margins, and great potential. You said that while you didn't know which companies would do the best, you could have made some kind of sector play because the entire sector had been decimated. These exact same words, including those about not knowing which businesses will dominate over time, can also be used to describe another industry which has recently been decimated. This industry is of course technology. How do you see these two investment ideas, pharmaceuticals and 93 in technology now, and what difference in the two situations makes the first a good opportunity for Berkshire and the second not one?","Well, it Charlie answers all the questions about mistakes, so I will turn the second question over to him. Personally, I think that the future of the pharmaceutical industry was easier to predict than the future of the high technology sector. In the pharmaceutical sector, almost everybody did well, and some companies did extremely well. In the other sector, whether or many permanent casualties in the high-tech sector. I would say that there is certainly nothing obvious to us about the fact that the tech sector as a group or viewed in aggregate would be a good buyer or be undervalued, whereas we should have had enough sense to recognize that the pharmaceutical industry as a group was undervalued. But the pharmaceutical industry has a far better record of returns on large amounts of equity over time. And with a high percentage of the participants having those returns than the tech industry, I wouldn't regard those two as comparable at all."
"It's become more and more important to me as it's become more and more difficult to find a rational discussion about the stock market. This weekend really is a breath and fresh air for most of us, I think. One of the places I refer to a lot is Benjamin Graham. What worries me now is what he referred to as a period in 1929 in the early 30s is a lab experiment that were normal intrinsic values and margins of safety broke down or seemed to. I wonder how much you think that might happen now in the next few years and how much you worry about that with the investments you're making.","We generally believe you can just see anything in markets. It's extraordinary what happens in markets over time. It gets sorted out eventually. We have seen companies sell for tens of billion dollars that are worthless. At times, we have seen things sell for 20%. A number of things, not hard to find perfectly decent people running themselves for literally 20% or 25% of what they were worth. We have seen and will continue to see everything. It's just the nature of markets. They produce wild, wild things over time. The track is occasionally that they can find one of those wild things and not to get carried away one other wild things happen. The wild things create their own truth for a while and you have to... That's the reason they're happening. People are getting pleasant experiences and all that. You'll see everything if you're on markets for a reasonable period of time. We don't see any great cases of dramatic undervaluation by this market. It doesn't like... We're seeing because there's this perhaps a speculative domain in a particular area of the market. We do not see that creating incredible undervaluation in other places. What's happening there may lead undervaluation a few years from now or may not. I don't know that. It doesn't like you can find things that are worth double or there about what you're paying. Because frankly, there's so much money sloshing around that if you found such a thing, it would be very likely corrected by some buyout types. We would love to find businesses that are selling for half of what they're intrinsically worth. We don't find that. We do find a lot of cases where we think the valuations on the high side are unbelievable. We have been in periods in the past where we've felt almost everything was being given away too. You'll get those extremes, most of the time the markets end up positioned where there's a little of both. But every now and then, it gets into a position where there's a lot of one or the other. We would love it if we could find a lot of reasonable-sized companies that were selling it. What we thought were half of the intrinsic value. We're not finding them, Charlie. We do think that the present time is a very unusual period. It's hard to think of a time when residential real estate and common stocks and so on. Roast so rapidly in price. There was so much easy money floating around. I mean, this is a very unusual period. What's fascinating, and I'm sure you thought of it, is that you could now have a business saw a few of them earlier this year. We'll say that might have been selling for ten billion dollars for the business itself. It could not have borrowed probably a hundred million dollars in debt with an equity valuation of ten billion. But the business itself would not, as a private business, would not have been able to borrow a hundred million. But the owners of that business, because it's a public, can borrow many billions of dollars on their little pieces of paper because they have this market valuation. The company itself couldn't borrow one-twenty if they saw what the individuals could borrow. That's happened to a degree before. But this has probably been as extreme as anything that's happened probably including the twenties. That doesn't mean there's a parallel to it, but it's been pretty extreme, is right? I think it probably is the most extreme that has happened in modern capitalism. In my lifetime, I would say the thirties were the... It created the worst recession in the English-speaking world in 600 years. And it was very extreme. All you could eat in Omaha through the thirties for a quarter, from Henderson's cafeteria. And now we're seeing the other face of what capitalism can do. And this is almost as extreme as the thirties were, but in a different direction. It's zero unemployment, rampant speculation, etc., etc., it's an amazing period. That does not make it easy to predict however the outcome. It says to us, though, certain things we want to stay away from. I mean, basically, it's precautionary to us. It does not spell opportunity. Although there's no question that the... In the last year, the ability to monetize shareholder ignorance has never been exceeded, I think."
"I'd like to ask you to elaborate a bit how you think about opportunity cost. And I think I'm going to be elaborating very much on the very last question that was asked. First of all, in the annual report, you say explicitly that you look for 10% pre-tax return on equity in looking at common stocks. And I think you talked earlier about how you built up from that for five to six percent after tax return and then you layer on inflation and then layer on taxes. My first question would be how do you adjust that required rate of return across periods of time. So for example, when interest rates are higher and do you look for a different equity premium return over different periods of time?","The question on opportunity costs and the 10% we mentioned, you know, basically that's the figure we quit on. And we quit on why we don't want to buy equities where our real expectancy is below 10%. Now that's true where the short rates are 6% or where the short rates are 1%. We just feel that it would get very sloppy to start dipping below that and we would add, we feel also obviously that we will get opportunities that are at least at that level and perhaps substantially above. So there's just a point at which we drop out of the game. And it's arbitrary. There's no scientific studies or anything. But I will bet you that a lot of years in the future, we or you will be able to find equities that you understand or we understand and that have a probability of returns at 10% or greater. Now, once you find a group of equities in that range, not leaving aside the problem of huge sums of money which we have, then we just buy the most attractive. That usually means the ones we feel dishearous about, I mean, is a practical matter. There's just some businesses that possess economic characteristics that make their future prospects far out, far more predictable than others. There's all kinds of businesses that you just can't remotely predict what they'll earn and you just have to forget about them. But when we get, so we, we have over time gotten very partial to the businesses where we think the predictability is high, but we still want a threshold return of 10%, which is not that great after tax anyway. Charlie, do you want to comment on that portion of the question first? Yeah, I'll be, I think in the last analysis, everything we do comes back to opportunity cost. But to some extent, in fact, to some considerable extent, we are guessing at our future opportunity cost. Warren is basically saying that he's guessing that it's in due course to put out money at pretty attractive rates of return and therefore he's not going to waste a lot of power now at lower returns. But that's an opportunity cost calculation. And if interest rates were to more or less permanently settle at one percent or something like that, and Warren were to re-appraise his notions of future opportunity cost, he would change the numbers. Like Ken said, what do you do when you change your view of the facts? Well, you change your conduct. But so far at least, we have hurdles in our mind, which are basically, they involve implicitly future opportunity cost. Right now, with our 16 billion that's getting one and a quarter percent pretext, that's $200 million a year. We could very easily buy governments doing in 20 years and get roughly 5 percent. So we could change that $200 million a year to $800 million a year of income. And we're making a decision as Charlie says that it's better to take $200 million for a while on the theory that we'll find something that gives us 10 percent or better than to commit to the $800 million a year and then find that in a year there are about one. The better opportunities came along that what we'd committed to had a big principal loss in it. But that's, you know, that's not, it's not, it's not terribly scientific. But it all I can tell you is in practice. It's, it seems to work pretty well. And years ago when Warren ran a partnership, when to some extent, the partnership that I ran was the, it operated in the same way, we implicitly did what you're suggesting in that part of the partnership funds were in so-called event arbitrage investments. And those tended to generate returns occasionally when the market generally was in the tank. And alternative investments would more mimic the general market. So we were doing what this academic theory, Chris Grimes, you know, 40 years ago. And, but we didn't use the modern lingo. Yeah, we've got some preferences for having a lot of money coming in all the time. But we do go into into insurance transactions with huge volatility, which could mean that a, a big chunk of money could go out at one time or in a very short period of time. And we won't give up a lot in expectable return for smoothness. But if you give us a choice of having money come in every week and the and the same present value of money coming in in very lumpy ways that we wouldn't know about, we would choose the smooth. But if you give us a choice of a higher present value for the lumpiness, we will take the lumpiness. And that's usually the choice that's, I mean, that's usually, we get offered that choice. And other people value smoothness so highly that we do get a spread in our view for lumpy returns. We are writing and then we're going to close this up. But you will read a lot, or you may hear a lot, maybe you've heard it already, PepsiCoA was having a contest. They're going to have a drawing in September. The contest goes through a lot of little phases. But in the end, there's going to be one person who's going to have one chance in a thousand of winning a billion dollars. That billion dollars will have a present value of maybe 250 million. If whoever gets to that position hits the number, we will pay it. And we don't mind paying out 250 million dollars as long as we got paid appropriately for us. And that would create bad cash flow that particular week. We're willing to, maybe even for two weeks, we're willing to assume that for a payment and very, very few people in the world are, even those that can afford it. We would even assume it for two and a half billion present value. We'd want more proportionally to assume it for that. But Charlie and I think would agree that we would take that on if we got paid well enough for it. We wouldn't do it for 25 billion. But we will do things. And therefore, we get the calls on that sort of thing. And that is more profitable business over time than bread and butter business. It also can lead you having an intense interest in watching the television show when the drawing takes place. Making sure who draws the number to. Charlie, you have anything to add? And then we'll. Yeah, but once you're talking about opportunity cost that's personal to yourself and your own situation and your own abilities, you've departed from modern finance. Totally. And that's what we've done. We're intelligently making these guesses as best we can based on our own circumstances and our own abilities. I think it's crazy to do it based on somebody else's circumstances and somebody else's abilities."
"we have been discussing how much return that a company has helped us to get in the past few years and for the future too. So I believe there are many people are concerned about how much have we given to the society in return. And gentlemen, would you please share with us about your philosophy and the company policies and how much the Berkshire has done in terms of philanthropy and charities.","Yes, there are figures in the annual report that bear on that. One thing we did was an entirely volunteer. I think we gave about 2.6 billion to the federal government last year in income taxes. I'm not sure. I looked at General Electric and Microsoft in a couple of the large. We may have paid more in federal income tax than any other US company. I don't take my word for that because it could be Walmart paid more. I wouldn't be surprised if Walmart paid more. But I did look at a couple of the bigger, more than GE or Microsoft, both of which have market caps that are three times our size. The shareholder designated contribution program was 18 or so million as I remember. And then we detailed the contributions in the report made by the other companies. But I would argue that to the extent that GEICO, for example, is a more efficient way of delivering and personal auto insurance than overwhelmingly that its competitors are. And then it's 15% is a fair indication of how much it is saving people. And then on a $4 billion premium volume, there is something more than $600 million that consumers save by a more efficient way of distribution, which has been honed to a fine art by the GEICO management, really delivering the goods and services that people want in an economical way is a very important part of the contribution that any company makes to society as well as the taxes they pay and their actual corporate philanthropy. We are not big believers in giving away the money of the owner of a butcher acting as their representatives and giving away their money to philanthropy. We think that the shareholders should, it's their money. And we had a partnership of 10 people. If I were the managing partner, I would not feel I should make the decisions on philanthropy for the other nine people. I would let them all make their own decisions. We do not think that corporations generally should be passing out money to the pet charities of the CEO. And we don't do it at Berkshire. But we do let the shareholders make those designations in. And as I say, I think our primary kind of, thank you. I think the best contribution, actually we can make the society over 10 or 15 years, is finding ways to deliver goods and services that people want to them at lower cost than the alternatives that were previously available to them, Charlie. Yeah, well, I applaud the questioners yearning for an answer to the question of, isn't there something more in this game than making and filing up money? And shouldn't we be thinking about what we owe in return and what's going to go back in return? In the monger case, I think 100% is going to go back and return for a reason different from that in the public case. There's an old saying, how much did old Charlie lead? And the answer is, I believe he left it all. In essence, it all has to go back one way or another. You can't take it with you, that's the iron rule of the game. And I do think it's important to think about what you do for other people and what example do you set with your own life or your own corporate life. And I do think that Berkshire stacks up pretty well on that respect and do course when we get into our gantuan charities bearing the imbuffet. And I guess that will be done pretty well too."
"In recent years, tobacco companies have been compelled to pay large damages for marketing their unhealthy but discretionary products. My question has two parts. First, does the potential for similar damage liabilities reduce the intrinsic value of Coca-Cola, seized candies, dairy queen, or any other business which sells discretionary products of questionable healthfulness, not that I don't like these products? And second, are either of you concerned that a possible erosion in the principle of caveat emptor is undermining the legal basis of contracts in general.","Well, the products you described I've been living on for 70 years. So they'll probably haul me in as a witness if they don't do much damage. So I think if you're opposed to sugar, and I think the average human being eats something like 550 pounds dry weight of food a year. And I think 125 pounds are there about side of the look. It consists of sugar in one form or another. I mean, it's in practically every product that you have. And it happens to be in Coca-Cola, it happens to be in seized candy. But it's in practically everything. It's over 20% of what Americans are consuming one way or another. And the average lifespan of Americans keeps going up. So I would not be worried at all about product liability in connection with those companies. But product liability, generally, is an area that is a fertile field for the plaintiff's bar. And we are conscious in buying into businesses. And we have passed up some businesses because we were worried about the product liability potential. Unless there is some legislative solution, I think you will see more and more of the GDP going into liability awards. And whether there will be any change by legislation, I don't know. But it's a big field. And the lottery ticket aspect of it is so attractive. Because if an attorney can gamble a modest amount of time, or even a reasonable amount of time, and have a potential payoff of 10 or 20, or maybe in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars, that's a decent lottery ticket. Who knows what 12 people are going to be on the jury? As one of my friends, as a lawyer, he said Lincoln said, you can fool all of the people some of the time, and all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but not all of them all the time. He says, I'm just looking for 12 that you can fool all of the time. And all you have to do is get an award. And the odds are fairly favorable in a nation where lots of zeros have lost meaning to people. So it's a very real concern in any business we get into in terms of trying to evaluate product liability. Charlie? What's particularly pernicious is the increasing political power of the plaintiffs contingency bar. If you're on a state supreme court, in most places, you're on for life, at least you're on for life, if you want to stay for life. And the one thing that could get you off the court would be to really irritate some important group. And I think that greatly helps a lot of abusive conduct in the courts. I think the judges of the country haven't been nearly as tough as they should be on junk science, junk economic testimony, trashy lawyers. And I don't see many signs that it's getting better. In Texas, they actually improved the Supreme Court of Texas, which really needed it. So there are occasional glimmers of life. We make our decisions in insurance and in buying businesses with a very pessimistic attitude toward the chances of that particular ill, the Charlie described being even moderated. I mean, we think we would project out that the trend would accelerate. But that's just our natural way of building an emergency safety in decisions. Don't worry about eating the seized candy or the dairy queen or the coke. If you read the papers long enough, I use a lot of salt. And I was always being warned about that. And then a few years ago, they started saying, you can't get enough salt. No, I don't know what the answer is. But I feel terrific, man."
"The question is regarding the fact that you don't report details of anything under $750 million. And with the change of the values of a small cap in relation to large cap, would that be something that perks our or individuals might try to look as opportunity with the small cap premium shrinking as it has?","We don't worry about whether a stock is small cap or large cap except at the extent that by now we've gotten to a point where anything below a certain level just is not of interest to us because it can't be material to our results. We never think of opportunities as existing because of something as small cap or sectors or all that generally gets merchandise. So our cutoff point is set more or less at the point where we think it's material. That's not as defined by the SEC. We could have a higher limit. But we think when you get down below 2% of assets or thereabouts that reporting the positions would not affect anybody's calculation of intrinsic value or give them insights about the way we run the business. But it would be more for the people who are looking for things to piggyback on. So we will move the cutoff point up as we go along because of our size. We will never be in companies that have capitalizations that are half a billion or a billion dollars because we just can't put enough money. Occasionally we'll be in one just by accident. But we're looking at things that we can put $500 million in ourselves at least to $500 million or 5% position as a $10 billion market cap. That limitation has hurt, will hurt, is hurting our performance to some degree. You would, the virtue were exactly 1-100th of its present size and all respects owning the operating businesses that did but all 1-100th of size. Our prospects would be better than they are with the kind of money we have presently."
"I applied Berkshire for starting the class B shares. My question deals with tobacco stocks, which have been beaten down lately. Does Berkshire own any tobacco stocks and are some of these stocks attractive now that prices are down on some of them and in particular a company called USD.","We have owned, we won't comment on what we own now, but we have owned tobacco stocks in the past. We've never owned a lot of them, although we may have made a mistake by not owning a lot of them. But we've owned tobacco stocks in the past and I've had people write me about whether we should do it or not. We own a newspaper in Buffalo at Carries, tobacco advertising. We don't, well actually Charlie's a director of the sensational of warehouse chain called Costco, which used to be called price Costco, you know, they sell cigarettes. So we are part of the distribution chain with 100% on subsidiary in Buffalo news. And so we have felt that if we felt they were attractive as an investment, we would invest in tobacco stocks. We made a decision some years ago that we didn't want to be in the manufacturer chewing tobacco. We were offered the chance to buy a company that has done sensational well, subsequently. And we sat in a hotel in Memphis and in the lobby and talked about it and finally decided we didn't want to do it. Can I give you some? That wasn't because we thought it wouldn't do well. We knew it was going to do well. Now, why would we take the ads for those companies or why would we own a supermarket, for example, the sales them or a 7-11, you know, our convenience store that sells them or something of the sort and not want to manufacture them. I really can't give you the answer that precisely, but I just know that one bothers me and the other doesn't bother me. And I'm sure other people would draw the line in a different way. So the fact that we have not been significant holders of tobacco stocks has not been because they have been on a boycott list with us. That just means that overall we were uncomfortable enough about their prospects over time that we did not feel like making a big commitment in Charlie. Yeah. I think each company, each individual has to draw its own ethical and moral lines. Personally I like the messy complexity of having to do that. It makes life interesting. I hadn't heard that before. We'll make him in charge of this decision at all. But I don't think we can justify our call particularly. We just have to draw the line somewhere between what we're willing to do and what we're not and we draw it by our own lights. We own a lot of bonds at one time of RJR and Abysco, for example, meant some years back. Should we own the bonds, not on the stock, should we own the stock, but not be willing to own the business? Those are tough calls. Probably the biggest distributor of cigarettes in the United States is probably Walmart. Just because they're the biggest seller of everything. They're the biggest seller of Gillette products and they're huge. Do I find that morally reprehensible? I don't. If we own all of Walmart, we'd be selling cigarettes at Walmart. Other people might call it differently and I wouldn't disagree with them."
my question refers to two businesses namely McDonald's and Derrick Green. Are there major differences in the investment characteristics between McDonald's and Derrick Green and if yes would you explain them?,"Yeah there are major differences. McDonald's owns perhaps in the area of a third of all locations worldwide. I can't tell you exact percentage but if they've got 23,000 outlets they own many many thousands of them and operate them and then of the remainder they own a very high percentage and lease them to their operators, their franchisees. So they have a very large investment on which they get very good returns and physical facilities all over the world. Derrick Green has County Orange Julius 6000 plus operations of which 30 odd are operated by the company and even those summer and joint ventures or partnerships. So the investment in fixed assets is dramatically different between the two. The fixed assets investment by the franchisee or the person is landlord obviously is significant in Derrick Green but it's not significant to the company as the franchisee or. So the capital employed in Derrick Green is relatively small compared to the capital employed in McDonald's but McDonald's also makes a lot of money out of owning those locations and receives whereas Derrick Green will in most cases receive 4% of the franchisees sales in terms of a royalty at McDonald's that there's that more than that percentage plus bus rentals and so on. So they're two different very different economic models. They both depend on the success of the franchisee in the end. You have to have a good business for the franchisee to over time have a good business for the parent company. Both companies have that situation to deal with. Charlie? I've got nothing to add. The 4% is not very much when you stop to think about providing a group of franchisees with the nationally recognized brand and quality control and all sorts of desirable business aids. So 4% is at the low if you look at the whole industry 4% is on the lower part of the range but part of the range. Part of what attracted us was the fact that the charges to the franchisees are low at Derrick Green. A successful franchisee can sell his operation significantly more than he has invested in tangible assets and we want it that way obviously because that means he's got a successful business and it means that over time we will have a successful business. You want a franchise operator to make money and you want him to create a capital asset that's worth more than he's put in. That's the goal."
"My question involves Geico. If I remember correctly from last year, Geico had about 2% of the insurance market and had approximately $4 billion in float. My question is, as their market share expands, will they'll float in your expectation, expand in a somewhat linear fashion, and relate into that. What is your guess might be the top end? Could they ultimately become as dominant as a Gillette or a Coke and their businesses or as the nature of it such that they might stop at 10% of the market or 15% when they start to hit a significant hurdle? And second, to follow up on this other gentleman's question, if you don't adjust for risk by using higher discount rates, how do you adjust for risk or do you?","Well, the second question, we adjust by simply trying to buy it at a big discount from that present value calculated using the risk free interest rate. So, interest rates are 7%, we discounted back the flows, which Charlie says I never do anyway, and he's correct, but in theory, if we discount them back at 7%, then we would look at a substantial discount from that present value number in order to warn buying. The question about Geico, the float will grow more or less proportionately to premium volume. There's a moderate amount of our float, the very small amount of the float that's accounted for by some discontinued lines from the past, and of course that won't grow the same way. But if we double the size of Geico on premium volume, we'll come close to doubling the size of the float. The history of auto insurance is quite interesting. It's something that isn't studied at business schools and should be studied because the great insurance companies of the early 1900s were at Hartford Travelers. They had these agency forces nationwide and wrote what was then more property business. They wrote a lot of fire business in those days, and of course the automobile only came in in the early 1900s. So, their orientation was to property business, but they had this huge agency force throughout the United States. There were property business insurance agents representing these big companies in every throughout the country. They had lots of capital. Now if you look at the business in 1997, something well over 20%, close to 25% of the personal auto and homeowners business insurance is written by a company called State Farm. State Farm was started, I believe, in the 20s by a fellow in Bloomington Illinois with no capital speak of no agency force initially. And started as a mutual company, no incentive. Stock options, no capital invested where it could become a billionaire, if he built the business up or anything. So here this company starts without any of the capitalists incentives that we are taught are essential to a business growing. And in a huge industry, becomes the dominant player. It has more than twice the market share of all state, the second player, becomes the dominant company against these extremely entrenched competitors with great distribution systems and loads of capital. Now I say that's an incidentally state farm on the Fortune 500 list of companies has the third largest network of any company in the United States. Number three from Bloomington, Illinois with a guy with no money in it. Now how does that happen? Well I would say that's a subject we're studying in business schools because Darwin used to say that anytime he got any evidence that flew in the face of his previous convictions, he had to write it down in the first 30 minutes. The mind was such that it would reject contrary evidence to cherished beliefs. And certainly there's some cherished beliefs around business schools that might at least find some interesting aspects in studying how a company could become the third largest company in that work in the country with no apparent advantage going in. There's another company down in Texas called USAAA, United States for the United Services Auto Association and it's been enormously successful as billions of net worth, the loads of satisfied policy orders, the highest free, new ratio among policy orders in the country. Nobody studies that to my knowledge either. The people who started Geico came from that company in 1936, Leo Goodland and his wife who had worked for USAAA went over and started this little Dico company with practically no capital. And now we have about 2.7% of the market and we're right, probably 3.5 billion of voluntary auto this year. Catching a state farm is going to be very difficult so I wouldn't want to predict we do that. I will predict that we will gain very materially and market share over the next 10 years and we will gain materially this year but we will we will we have got a we have got a very good mouse trap. I said in the report that 40% of you would save money insuring with I didn't say 100% or 80% or 60% because there are areas and professions where somebody else is going to have a lower price than we are. But across the country we are going and for all classes of citizens we are going to have a low price, the low price more often than anyone else. We've got that because we've got low costs and our costs are going to get lower and we've got a virtue of circle going in terms of the feeding on itself. So Geico will grow a lot but I state farm is plenty tough so I'm not going to predict catching state farm. I'm not even going to predict catching all state but we'll catch somebody and Charlie you want to say any more? Well I love your example of state farm. I mean the idea of picking some extreme example and asking my favorite question which is what in hell is going on here. That is the way to wisdom in this world and it is too bad. A lot of the mutual companies are now trying to demutualize, help buy a bunch of consultants and so forth and they are not looking at state farm, they are looking at some other model. Everybody can't be a state farm. That place got some fundamental values into its operating mechanics the way it's selected personnel, the way it's selected agents, the way it discarded agents. It was huge discipline but didn't you agree in that conversation? Yeah somebody you would say somebody had to do something very right but the question I don't know anybody saying what they did that was right. They don't want to because it doesn't fit the pattern and something like a state farm happens in this world you should try to understand it. When something like a Geico happens in this world you should try to understand it. In 1948 I think it was two thirds or three quarters, two thirds of Geico was for sale because originally back these two people from USA died and state had a stock percent in 1948. You couldn't sell it. That's how Ben Graham ended up buying it for Graham Newman because they hocked it all over for six months. They went to all the big insurance companies and the insurance companies who could see this company on a very very tiny scale offering a product for way less money and making lots of money doing it. They simply couldn't shake themselves loose from the miss of the past to step up and buy. They could have bought it for a million to a hundred thousand dollars as I remember. They owned the whole company and instead they've watched their own distribution system get their heads beaten in over the years and all the time with these ideas from the past. You have to be very careful to look hard at what's really happening. You'll be very said you can observe a lot just by looking."
"I've got two questions for you. First, I'd like to hear your thoughts on selling security short and what your experience has been recently and over the course of your career. The second question I'd like to ask is how you go about building a position in a security you've identified. Using USG as a recent example, I believe you've bought most of your shares at between 14 and $15 a share. But certainly, you must have thought it was a reasonable investment at 18 or 19. Why was 14 and 15 the magic number? And now that it's dropped to around 12, do you continue to build your position? How do you decide what your ultimate position is going to be?","Well, we can't talk about any specific security. Our buying techniques depend very much on the kind of security we're dealing in. It's a security that might take many, many months to acquire, and other times you can do it very quickly, and sometimes it may pay to pay up and other times it doesn't. And sure that you never know exactly what the right technique is to use as you're doing it, but you just use your best judgment based on past purchases. But we can't discuss any specific one. Short selling is interesting. It's an interesting item to study because it's ruined a lot of people. It is the sort of thing that you can go broke doing. Bob Wilson, there's famous stories about him and Resorts International. He didn't go broke doing. In fact, he's done very well subsequently. But being short something where your loss is unlimited, it's quite different than being long something that you've already paid for. It's tempting. You see way more stocks that are dramatically overvalued in your career than you will see stocks that are dramatically undervalued. It's the nature of securities markets to occasionally promote various things to the sky. So the securities will frequently sell for five or ten times what they're worth, and they will very, very sell them for 20% or 10% of what they're worth. Therefore, you see these much greater discrepancies between price and value on the overvaluation side. So you might think it's easier to make money on short selling. All I can say is it hasn't been for me. I don't think it's been for Charlie. It is a very, very tough business because of the fact that you face unlimited losses. Because of the fact that people that have overvalued stocks, very overvalued stocks are frequently on some scale between promoter and crook. And that's why they get there. And they also know how to use that very valuation to bootstrap value into the business. Because if you have a stock that's selling at 100, that's worth ten, obviously it's to your interest to go out and issue a whole lot of shares. And if you do that, when you get all through the value, it can be 50. In fact, there's a lot of chain-letter type stock promotions that are sort of based on the implicit assumption that the management will keep doing that. And if they do it once and build up the 50 by issuing a lot of shares at 100, when it's worth ten, now the value is 50 and people say, well, these guys are so good at that. Let's pay 200, 400, or 300, and then they can do it again and so on. It's not usually that quite that clear in their minds. But that's the basic principle underlying a lot of stock promotions. And if you get caught up in one of those that is successful, you can run out of money before the promoter runs out of ideas. In the end, they almost always work. I mean, I would say that the things that we have felt like shorting over the years, the batting average is very high in terms of eventual. They would work out very well eventually if you held a probe. But it is very painful. And it's in my experience, it was a whole lot easier to make money on the long side. I had one situation, actually an arbitrage situation when I was in, was when I moved to New York in 1954, so it was in much junior July of 1954, that involved a surefire type of transaction and arbitrage transaction that had to work, but there was a technical wrinkle in it and I was short something. And I felt like for a short period of time, I felt like Fnova was feeling last fall. I mean, it was very unpleasant. You can't make, in my view, you can't make really big money doing it because you can't expose yourself to the loss that would be there if you did do it on a big scale. And Charlie, how about you? Well, Ben Franklin said, if you want to be miserable during Easter or something like that, he says borrow a lot of money if he repaid his lamp or something to that effect. Similarly, being short something, which keeps going up because somebody is promoting it in a half crooked way and you keep losing and they call on you for more margin, it just isn't worth it to have that much irritation in your life. Isn't it that hard to make money somewhere else with less irritation? It would never work on a Berkshire scale anyway. I mean, you could never do it for the kind of money that would be necessary to do it with in order to have a real effect on Berkshire's overall value. So it's not something we think about. It's interesting though. I mean, I've got a copy of the New York Times from the day of the Northern Pacific corner and that was a case where two opposing, as was Titans, each owned over 50% of the Northern Pacific company and Northern Pacific Railroad. And when two people each own over 50% of something, you know, it's going to be interesting. And Northern Pacific on that day went from 170 to 1000 and it was selling for cash because you had to actually have a certificate that day rather than a normal settlement date. And then the front page of the New York Times, which incidentally sold for a penny in those days, it's had a little more inflation than Coca-Cola. Front page of the New York Times right next to the story about it, it told about a brewer and New York, New Jersey, who had gotten a margin call that day because of this and he jumped into a pad of hot beer and died. And that's really never appealed to me as, you know, the ending of a financial career. And who knows, you know, when they had a corner and pickly wiggly, that corner and Auburn motors in the 1920s, I mean, there were corners. That was part of the game. Back when it was played in a kind of a foot loose manner. And it did not pay to be short. Actually, during that period, you might find it interesting. And the current issue of the New Yorker, maybe one issue ago, the one that has an interesting story about Ted Turner, there's also a story about Heady Green. And Heady Green was one of the original incorporators of halfway manufacturing, half of our Berkshire halfway operation back in the 1880s. And Heady Green was just piling up money. She was a richest woman in the top, maybe in the world, certainly in the United States, maybe some queen was richer abroad. But Heady Green just made it by the slow old fashioned way. A doubt of Heady was ever short at anything. So as a spiritual descendant of Heady Green, we're going to stay away from shorts at Berkshire. Okay, area six. The incident in this story, it's a very interesting story. As I read the story, it's almost conclusively clear to me that she forged a will to try and collect some significant money from, I believe, her aunt. And it was a very, very famous trial back in whenever it was 1860 or 70. And they found against Heady when it got all through, but she still managed to become the richest woman in the country."
"This is on the relationship between the A and the V shares. On page one of the booklet, it states, quote, each share of class A stock is entitled to one vote per share and each class of each share of class B stock is entitled to one to hundreds of one vote per share, close quote. Calculating the voting weight per share would therefore be 200 class B shares, equally one vote, equally weighted of one class A share. However, the class B share price is one-thirtyth traditionally of a class A share. Even that the B share owners are purchasing into the same corporation and assets as the A share owners and the cash is just as green no matter which share you buy. Therefore, it would be logical that the voting weight and price relationship of the shares be proportional all around, either one-thirtyth or one-two-hundredth of pricing and voting weight respectively. The question there for is why are the B shares not given voting weight of one-thirtyth instead of one-two-hundredth or conversely why the B shares are not priced at one-two-hundredth of an A share. This may or may not be popular depending on which share you own. And I would appreciate your insight on that.","That's a good question. You may not be aware of the history of the issue. But we issued the B shares. There were no, I mean, they're just a common share. So we renamed the old shares A shares. But we issued the B shares, whatever it was, what, seven or eight years ago, Charlie, and something like that. And we did that in response to some people, particularly fellow in Philadelphia, who we felt was going to induce people who really didn't understand Berkshire Hall into a terribly expensive way of owning tiny pieces of Berkshire, probably sold on the basis of an historical record that we did not think was representative of what could be incurred in the future. In other words, we were disturbed by somebody who saw a chance to make a lot of money off of people who were really uninformed using our stock as the vehicle. And we were going to reap the unhappiness of those people. Subsequently, they're going to run into tax problems and various administrative cost problems and so on. So to ward that off, and only to ward that off, I mean, we issued the B stock, which effectively put that fellow out of business because it was a better vehicle for doing what he was going to try and get people to do at great profit for himself. And when we issued it, it had not existed before, and we made, we put two differences in it from the A stock. A, we wanted to create a lower value for shares, so we did it on a 130th basis. At the time, it was around $1,100 or thereabouts because the A was selling for in the low of 30,000. But we put on the prospectus, which is a very unusual prospectus in other respects. We put on there, we were going to differentiate the stock in only two ways, but we were going to differentiate it in those two ways. And one was the voting power because we didn't want to issue the stock and we didn't want to change the voting situation much. And the second way was in terms of the designated charitable contributions, which the A was going to continue to enjoy and the B would not participate in. And the reason the B wasn't going to participate in it is because the amounts would have gotten to a point that would have been an administrative nightmare. I mean, this year, we designated $18 on the A shares. We've got a lot of one share B holders, which would be $0.60 and it just doesn't make any sense. And we saw that. So we just said, if you buy the B shares, you're buying into an instrument which economically is equal to 1 30th of an A in voting, it is not equal to 1 30th of an A because we don't want to change the voting that much. And it does not, it has a slight economic difference in terms of the fact it doesn't get to participate in the charitable contributions program, which is a very small item relative to the whole capitalization. But it's still, it's something. But we do not, you'll notice our A and B compared to other companies that have different voting arrangements. I was just looking at one the other day where the premium for the voting stock is 10 or 12 percent or something like that relative to economic interest. That's because people assume that if, you know, if the company is ever sold or anything like that, the guy that owns the A will get treated better than the B. And Charlie and I have been in a situation where we got somewhat taken because of a situation, because of a relationship like that. We will treat the B exactly as the A except for those two things which at the time of issuance we set out as being differences. And those two items everybody saw coming into the picture and they're going to stay, they will stay as part of the picture. Actually in terms of when the meeting will be held two years from now, you know, we aren't even going to vote by votes in a sense. I mean, I'm going to get a sense of what people want to do. But I regard in that respect, I think that it ought to be the most convenient for the most people, not for the most number of shares. A will not vote any different than B or anything because, you know, you're all individual people and I want whatever works best for the most. But in terms of those two other items, they were set out that way and they'll stay that way if we set out a different, we would not change the relationship once the two stocks once the way we were issued. We would not benefit one or relative to the other, but those are the terms of the two. Charlie? Yeah, we had the issue of the B-stock to frustrate the ambitions of this church promoter and yet we didn't want to split the A-stock down to all of it down to tiny little fractions, which would have frustrated him but forced us to have a stock split we didn't want. So we created a vehicle which was had these two slight disadvantages and that kept most of our capitalization in its traditional A-stock and also frustrated the promoter. It's an historical quirk, it's an accident of life. And the B is sold at a remarkably consistent relationship to the A. The discount got as low as, or as high I should say, as I think it was over 4% for a small period of time but it's generally speaking the B is sold at parity to very slightly below parity and indeed A shares get converted to B and that would not happen unless the B were at parity. So I think it's worked out pretty well. I mean we backed into it but I don't think anybody's been disadvantaged by it."
"I have two quick questions for you. Could you please comment on any observations that either of you may have concerning executive compensation and optional issuance? A topic that seems to be getting a lot more media attention and are we going to getting a little bit of excesses in that area? And my second question to you, Mr. Buffett, could you just give us some idea of what a normal day, how you would like to spend a reasonable normal day and working on the investment side of the equation or analysis or reading or just to give us some flavor of that?","ll answer the second question. First, very easy. I read a lot. And I talk on the telephone and I say, we have no meetings. We have no committees. We have no slide presentations. We have nothing. I mean, so I read a lot. I read annual reports. I read business publications. I could do it in way less time, but I enjoy doing it so I make it last. I mean, like some other activities in life. So it's the most boring job to anybody watching it, but I'm in love with it. So I like doing that. And I don't like talking about it a lot. I just like to kind of keep up with what's going on. Like I say, by this point in life, I could filter out so much of that. I just don't need to do that much of it. But I kind of enjoy just seeing what's going on bicariously through doing a lot of reading. And I spend some time on the phone. And I'm on the computer a lot playing bridge. And I get to do what I like all the time. We'll let Charlie describe what he does, which is even more bizarre. And then we'll talk about compensation adoption. Well, there's a little more foolishness in my life than ours. And including being chairman of a large hospital, I'm not suggesting that hospitals are foolish. I'm just suggesting that it takes a certain core of mind to be willing to be the chairman of a hospital. And so my life is even more, it's less rational than warrants. War on lives one of the most rational lives I've ever seen. And it's almost unbelievable."
"I have been a student and disciple of yourself Mr. Buffett for some time and especially Mr. Munger. I have adopted quite intensely your theories and capital allocation in the manner in which I run my business as well as my portfolio and quite pleased with the result so far. My question has to do with the original 1950s Buffett partnerships. There is some conflicting data in the various books about you pertaining to the rules of the partnership and the fees of the partnership. What I wanted to understand is I think some of the books are looted to the principle being guaranteed. I think 6% a year being guaranteed and then you took a fourth and the partnership got three fourths. In some cases, they talk about 4% and in some cases, they say there's no guarantee. I would just appreciate a clarification on that.","I'm not sure how much general interest there is to that but there was never any guarantee. There was a guarantee that I wouldn't get a penny myself. There was none of this 1% fee and all that sort of thing that hedge funds now normally have. After a short period of time, I told people I have all my capital in it basically. There was a guarantee I would have a common destiny. There was never guarantee of principle of any sort. Originally, the thing started by accident so that there were 11 different partnerships before they all got put together on January 1st, 1962, and Buffett partnership. With the 11 different partnerships, they had some different arrangements based on the preferences of the limited partners. I offered them an option of three or four different choices and different families made different choices. When we put them together, we settled on the 6% preferential with a quarter of the profits over that with a carry forward of all the efficiencies. Nobody was guaranteed anything on them. Charlie had a much better partnership. This was the third, as I remember, wasn't it, Charlie? Yes, but we were smaller and operating specialists, both some of the stockings. Yeah, backs were different."
"So if I were to take you back to the start of your invest investing careers, I assume it would have been harder for potential acquisition opportunities to come by. The question I would like to ask you, sirs, is how did you ensure that you had good enough deal flows coming to you to be able to choose from? I have one more question. The Berkshire subsidiaries do not have a retirement policy. What are the implications of this on retaining and motivating employees who are potential successors to senior management?","The first question about deal flow, which is not a, it's a term I actually don't like very much because I don't think I'm as deals exactly. That has a little too much of the connotation of something to be bought and then again something to be sold. But we do like acquisition opportunities and really that's just achieving that so that we get the calls when we should get the calls. And there are lots of those because we're talking about good-sized businesses. We're talking about owners that love their businesses and it's going to happen occasionally, but it's going to happen a few times a year probably. I think in the US now that we get a pretty reasonable percentage of the calls that we should get and that was not true 20 or 30 years ago. We didn't hear from anybody 20 or 30 years ago to speak of because we were looked at much more as being a marketable securities operation. And we just weren't, we weren't as well known. It feeds on itself obviously if we acquire companies and the people from whom we acquired them are happy about the deal. You know, we're going to hear from more people. We bought our first furniture operation in 1983. That really led to four other transactions because the people in the first one were happy and they talked to us about the second one and the people in the second one were happy and so on. So, you know, it's like a Charlie always describes compound interest as being like, you know, being at the top of a very large hill with wet snow and starting with a snowball and getting it rolling down hill. And that's a little bit like the acquisition situation works. We've been on a, by being around 38 years, it's been a long, it's been a high mountain in terms of the length of snowball is going by now it's going at a pretty good clip and it's pretty good size and attracts a lot of snow. And that's, that's good for us outside the United States. We do not seem to be on the radar screen so we don't seem to hear about those as much. But we were hearing about enough in the United States. It's not a flow in a sense of I don't hear about one a week. You know, I don't probably hear about one a month. But the ones we want to hear about most of them, I think we're, we're getting the calls now. I think we're getting a higher percentage of the calls now than ever in our history we would have gotten. And you know, that's all to the good and if we can do the same thing outside this country, that would be a plus too, but, but this country is a big market and we'll just try and spread the word further. Charlie, what was that other question that? Well, he talked some about deal flow and there's a general assumption that it must be easy to somehow arrange things that you just sat behind a desk and people brought in one wonderful opportunity after another and you finally selected two out of a hundred and it would be a virtual sense. That was the attitude and venture capital until the last two or three years. We didn't have any of that in the early days or at one. Yeah, that's right. We were finding our own securities and we were just looking at the public markets to see what was available in securities. And we started buying companies. There must have been 20 years when we didn't buy more than one or two a year. Yeah, they were fairly few in part between and we didn't have the money to buy right back when it was either. I mean, it was a big deal when we bought associated cotton shops for what in effect was four million or when we bought a social cone when we had to come up with six million of equity as I remember for that deal. And National and Demory itself was seven million for National and Demory and I think a million for a million seven for National Fire Marine. I mean, that was that was all we can handle on those days. So the snow ball is, you know, it's build up as it's gone down the mountain and we hope there's a lot of mountain left and a lot of wet snow and we're looking for it. We're looking for it to spare to say that we were rooting around for those opportunities. We weren't sitting behind our desk and waiting for some commission salesman to come in and present us with opportunities to sign our name. I can't think of anything we want in the early days that way. Warren, you chased down Jack Ringwald. Didn't you go to him? Well, Jack Ringwald, the Grand National and Demory and some of you here in the room knew Jack was a very interesting guy and a friend and Jack for 15 minutes every year would want to sell National and Demory. Something would make him mad. A claim would come in or something short. So for 15 minutes every year, he would want to sell and I had a friend of mine, Charlie Heider, who may be here today. And I had discussed this phenomenon of Jack being in heat once a year for 15 minutes. And I told Charlie if ever caught him in this particular phase to let me know. And that was a day that Charlie called and said, you know, Jack's ready. And I said, well, get him over here. So he came about 1130 and we made a deal in that 15 minute zone. And it's, it's, this is absolutely true. It's fascinating story because Jack having made the deal and we really did make it in 15 minutes. Jack having made the deal really didn't want to do it. And, but he was, he wouldn't have backed out of a deal. But he said to me after this after we check in hands, he said, well, he says, I suppose you'll want audited financial statements. And if I said, yes, he would have said, well, that's too bad. Then we can't have a deal. So I said, I wouldn't dream of looking at audited financial statements are the worst kind. You know. And then Jack said to me, he says, I suppose you'll want me to sell my agencies and do as well. And I said, Jack, I wouldn't buy those agencies and writing circumstances. If I said, yes to that, he would have, he would have, that I wanted to sell the agency said, well, I wouldn't be able to do it or we must have misunderstood each other. So we went through about three or four of those. And finally, Jack gave up and sold me the business. He was an honorable guy. I mean, because he really, I don't think wanted to do it. But we met down at Charlie's office at 19, I think, and Douglas. And Jack was about 10 minutes late picking up this seven million for National and them. He was about 10 minutes late because he was looking for a parking meter with a few minutes left on it. And that's when I knew he was my kind of guy. But anyway, this process is not easy. And practically anything where you sit behind that desk in this wonderful deal flow is just coming by. You're in a very dangerous seat."
My question is about the proliferation of short-term mindset to investing.,"Well, I think you put your finger on it and I you know we do think it's unhealthy obviously If you take There don't weigh them precisely measuring this, but I'm quite certain I'm right If you take the degree to which say either bonds or stocks The percentage of them that are held by people who Could Chains their minds tomorrow morning Based on a given stimulus Whether it be something the Fed does or whether it be Some kind of an accident in financial markets the percentage is far higher There is an electronic herd of people around the world managing huge amounts of money Who think that a decision on everything in their portfolio Should be made basically daily or hourly or by the minimum and That has increased turnover on the Fed on the New York Stock Exchange I don't know the exact figures, but I think it was down around the 15 or 20 percent range 40 years ago And it's increased at the 100 percent I believe plus now so and certainly in the bond the bond market to turnover of bonds has increased dramatically people used to buy bonds to own them and they buy bonds to trade them And there's nothing evil about that But it just means that the participants are playing a different game And that different game can have different consequences than in a buy-on-hold environment and I do think it it means that If you're trying to beat the other fellow on a day-to-day basis You know you're watching news events very carefully or watching the other fellow very carefully And if you think he's about to hit that key You know you're going to try and hit the key faster if that's if that's the game you're playing And if you're getting measured on results weekly so I I think that You have described the conditions that will lead to A result that That we've been talking about expecting at at some point. It's not new to markets though I mean markets that do crazy things over time Every time when Charlie and I were at Solomon they'd always talked us about five sigma events or six sigma events And that's fine if you're talking about flipping coins But it doesn't mean anything when you get human behavior involved and people do things that And intelligent people do things very intelligent educated people do things That are totally irrational And they do them in mass and you saw it in 1998 you saw it in 2002 and you'll see it again and you'll see it It's more likely to happen when you have people trying to De-currency bond stock markets day by day. It's I think it's a fool's game, but but You know it it maybe what's required to attract money when I set up my partnership I told the partners you know you'll hear from me once a year And I even thought in 1962 I put the partnerships together and May of 1962 the market got terrible And I actually thought of sending all my partners a letter and then sending it down to Brazil to have it reshipped back up Just to sort of test them out, but So how they felt about things But I you know I had a few with bad hearts. I decided it wasn't worth a while Charlie Yeah, when people talk about sigmas in terms of disaster potentialities in markets Uh, they're all crazy They got the idea that bad results in markets Would be predicted by Gaussian distributions and the way they Decided on that outcome was it made everything so easy to compute But they don't follow Gaussian distributions. You have to believe in the tooth fairy to believe that and the disasters are bigger and more irritating than Gauss would have predicted It's easier to teach as well. It's easier to teach too. Yeah. I I once asked us distinguished medical school professor why he was still Doing an obsolete procedure and he said it's so wonderful to teach There's more of that and there's more of that in finance departments than you might think It's very discouraging to learn advanced mathematics and You know how to do things that that None but the priesthood can do in your field and then find out it doesn't have any meaning You know, I mean and and what you do when confronted with that knowledge after you've invested these years to get your PhD You know and you maybe you've written a textbook in a paper too uh having a Having a revelation that That stuff has no utility at all and really has counter utility Uh, I'm not sure you know too many people gonna handle it well and uh and I think they just generally keep on teaching"
I was very interested in your Petro-China investment. Could you please tell us more about your thought process on investing in a complicated opaque country like China and Petro-China?,"Yeah, Petro-China itself is not a complicated or opaque, you know, the country you know has obviously different characteristics in many respects than the United States, but the company is very similar to big oil companies in the world and I Petro-China may have been it may have been the fourth largest, orthmost profitable oil company in the world last year. I may be wrong on that, but they produce 80 or 85% as much crude daily as Exxon does as I remember and it's a big big company and so and it's not complicated. I mean, you know, obviously a company with a half a million employees and all of that, but a big integrated oil company, it's fairly easy to get your mind around the economic characteristics that that will exist in the business. And in terms of being opaque, actually their annual report may well tell you more about that business, you know, than you will find from reading the reports of other oil giants and they do one thing that I particularly like, which other oil companies don't, at least in my knowledge, is that they tell you they will pay out X percent. I think it's 45% of the earnings absent some change in policy, but I like the idea of knowing in a big enterprise like that the 45% of what they earn is going to come to Berkshire and the remainder will be plowed back. It was bought not because it was in China, but it was but it was but it was but it was bought simply because it was very, very cheap in relation to earnings and relation to reserves and relation to daily oil production and relation to refining, whatever metric you want to use, it was far cheaper than Exxon or BP or or or shall or companies like that. Now you can say it should be cheaper because you don't know what will happen with at 90% owned by the government in China and that's obviously a factor that you stick in valuation, but I did not think that was a factor that accounted for the huge differential in the price at which it could be bought and so far it looks okay on that basis. We weren't there because it's China but we're not avoiding it because it's China either. We just we stick in a fairly appropriate number, but if you read the annual report of Petro-China, I think that there's no you will have as good an understanding of the company would if you read the annual report of any of the other big oil majors and then you would factor in your own thinking about whether there could be some huge disruption in Chinese-American relationships or something of the sort where you would lose for reasons other than what happened in terms of world oil prices and that sort of thing. But we're happy with it Charlie. I've got nothing to add. I think it's cheap enough. Obviously you're going to afford a little more country risk or regulatory risk or whatever. This is not complicated. Yeah, you can you cost as you know is a very big Russian oil company and in evaluating Russia versus China in terms of country risk you know you can make your own judgments. But in our view something like Petro-China was both cheaper and had less risk. But other people might see that differently."
I wondered if you feel that the speed with which information is available and disseminated today has affected your business buying decision process and do you believe that speed has caused you to miss opportunities? The question about seas expanding?,"No. The speed of information today affect our decision making process. Now we I would say that we we perform about like we were doing 30 or 40 years ago. I mean we read we read annual work. It isn't the speed of information. Read doesn't make any difference to us. It's the processing and finally coming to to some judgment that actually has some utility that is that it's it's a judgment about the price of a business or a part of a business of security versus what it's essentially worth and and none of that involves anything to do really with with with quick information. It involves getting good information but usually that that it's not we're not looking for needles and haystacks or anything of the sort. You know we like haystacks, not needles basically and and and and and we wanted to shout at us. And I would say that that well first we everything we've done has been reading public reports and and and then maybe asking questions around ascertain trade positions or product strengths or something of that sort. But we never have to we can make decisions very fast. I mean we could call it on a business or we can we can make up our mind whether we're interested in two or three minutes. I mean that that takes no time. We have to do a little checking on a few things subsequently but we don't need to get I can't think of anything with we we we really need lots of price data or things like that extremely fast to make any any decisions. We've got good management information systems and our operating businesses but that's that's just another thing. That's a question of keeping inventories where they should be and all of that sort of thing. I don't think the investment I think you could be in some place where the males were delayed three weeks and and the quotations were delayed three weeks and I think you could do just fine and investing."
"For the consumer franchise companies that births your own Coca-Cola and gelatin particular, in which emerging markets do you see the greatest 10-year potential for unit sales growth, and what economic, political, or social changes are precipitating that growth. Secondly, do you believe that the US market cap, as a percent of the world's, at 53% is near its zenith, and which countries do you believe will likely show the greatest percent growth in total market cap?","Well, I wish I had the answers. The first question though, obviously, when you're dealing with something like Cokis, is raw numbers. There's huge potential in the country, with the largest country in the world, in China, where the per capita consumption is very low, but is growing very fast. So it's very easy for me to predict and probably be right. Absent some tremendous up people, or some real surprise that China would be the fastest growth market among countries of any size in the world for Coke from this level. But that's based on, in fact, it's just got a huge number of people to clearly like the product that are starting from a very low base and where a lot more bottling infrastructure is going to be needed, but which will be supplied to facilitate that growth. With gelatine, it's a little different. People are already shaving. What you do is you upgrade the shaving experience that they have. So you have great differences in the quality of the blades available throughout the world. They call them shaving systems when you get into the more advanced ones. What happens is that people's disposable income grows. They trade up and they get a much more enjoyable shaving experience. They get better shaves than was the case when they were forced to rely on the lowest price product. But both of those companies have tremendous opportunities as the prosperity around the world as the standard of living grows. There's just no doubt in my mind that in the blatant razor business for gelatine, which is only a third of their business. But in the soft-brink business for Coke, they're going to share it. It'll be uneven in the years that it happens and all of that sort of thing. But I would almost guarantee you that 10 or 20 years from now, both of those companies will be doing a lot more business in those areas I name than currently. We don't find tuna to a lot more than that. I do not sit and work out country by country what's going to happen with a gelatine or Coke. It would be a waste of time. I wouldn't know the answer anyway. But I'm pretty sure the conclusion that both of them will prosper a great deal. And I would hate to be competing with either one of them here or anywhere else in the world. I mean, they have the winning hand. Charlie? Well, I'd agree with everything you said. And I'd like to add that if I knew for sure that the United States share a worldwide market capitalization was going to go from 53% down to 40%. I wouldn't know how to make money out of that insight by running around buying foreign securities. We just don't operate on that basis. And I mean, a few years ago, emerging markets were all the rage and every institution of the country was getting promoted by somebody who said I'm going to run an emerging markets fund and they felt they had to participate in it. Their advisors told them they had to participate. We regard that all as nonsense. In the end, you just have to think for yourself about what you know and what you don't know and go where that leads you. And you don't do it by buying into things with names on them or sectors or your country funds or that stuff. That's merchandise that's designed to sell to people. And it's usually a sold to people at the wrong time. Our game is defined a few intelligent things to do. It's not to stay up on every damn thing that's going on in the whole world."
"I have a specific question but not a trivial one. You regularly compare Berkshire Hathaway's performance to the S&P 500 which is very helpful and very interesting. But I haven't seen a correlation coefficient between the S&P 500 daily from day to day performs a close say and the Berkshire Hathaway's close. Now, it so happens for me and I'm sure some other people in the audience that I don't always have access to newspapers or the internet for that matter. News papers that publish Berkshire Hathaway's performance on a daily basis or even a weekly basis for that matter or monthly basis. It would be very helpful to know the extent of a correlation coefficient between those two variables. If you have that, would you just know what it is and if you don't, would you please consider calculating it in the future?","Well, it could be calculated but I don't think it would have much meaning. I mean, it would be an historical correlation coefficient which, you know, I would be very reluctant to have people place any way to. And I try to indicate even the limitations of the yearly comparison of the relevant performance because what was doable by us in the past is not doable today. I mentioned in my annual report, the best decade I ever had on comparative performance by far was the 50s. Now, I don't think it was because I was a lot smarter than unwilling to accept that. But, you know, I had some edge of, well, this probably 40 plus points per year, but I was working with it. That is no relevance to the day whatsoever. I would be misleading to publish it or to make calculations based on it. So I think that you would find, I don't know what you would find on a specific correlation between Berkshire and the S&P. You would find a lot of correlation. Well, you might not find so much of it. You would find it in Trinsigayoli between that and Coke and a few stocks like that. But I don't really think that's particularly useful information going forward. We have no objection. Maybe I want to make the calculation, but it wouldn't be something that would be of any utility to us. And if we don't think it's utility to us, we don't want to put it out for shareholders as being possible, utility. We do think that the S&P annual calculation has some meaning because it's an alternative for people to invest. They don't need us to buy the S&P. So unless over time we have some advantage over that, what are we contributing? What value is added by our management? So we think that people should hold us accountable even though we would prefer not to be because that it is a tough comparison for us as a tax paying entity against a non-Pretax calculation on the S&P. But we don't pay any attention to beta or any of that sort of thing. It just doesn't mean anything to us. We're only interested in price and value. That's what we're focusing on all the time and any kind of market movement, certainly don't mean anything. I don't know what Berkshire is selling for today. And it really makes no difference. It just doesn't make any difference. What does count is where it is 10 years from now. I can't tell you what it was selling for on May 4, 1983 or May 4, 1986. I don't care what it's all about on May 4, 1998. I do care where it is in general 10 years from now. That's where all the focus is. Charlie? Yeah, we're publishing data in the forum where we would like it if we were the passive shareholder. You're getting the data and you're getting it on a time schedule based on what we would want if we were in your position. We don't think the correlation confessions would help us. We don't think anything that relates either to volume, price action, relative strength, any of that sort of thing. And I'm very reminded when I was in my teens, I usually eat that stuff up. I mean, I was making calculations based on it all the time and kept charts on or even wrote an article or two on it. It just has no place in the operation. One of the pleasant things about dealing with warno these years is he's never talked about a correlation coefficient. If the correlation isn't so extreme, you can see it with the negra, he doesn't compute it. Okay, we're going to go to Zone Sex and I'm going to have a Dilly Bar and Charlie got one here too. These are terrific."
"Today we've already heard you talk about a few countries outside of the US. My question is if you are directly investing equities outside the United States, what would be your requirements for the market as a whole? And by the sighting things like the transparency of the accounting system, the breadth and liquidity in the market, the rights of shareholders, the stability of the currency. And it would be nice if you'd mention a few of these countries, kind of just a little addendum there is for the companies in these countries, how relevant do you believe the reconciliation to US gap contained in Form 20F really is?","Well, the answer is most of those points you mentioned would be of interest to us. We'd have to rule out anything where the markets aren't big enough. I mean, we are looking to put hundreds of millions of dollars into any single investment or the minimum. Certainly, we think in terms of 500 million as being a minimum, we make exceptions to that. And that's going to rule out a great many companies. Transparency of accounting and accounting rules. We care about that, but we can make adjustments mentally. In some respects, we may think in certain countries, the county is better than here. So, as long as we understand the accounting system, we will be looking toward the same kind of a discount model in our mind of how much cash is this business going to generate over years and how much is going to have to be put into it. And it's the same sort of calculation that goes into our thinking here. And here we don't follow strictly gap accounting and our thinking. So we don't, the accounting differences would not bother us as long as we understood those accounting differences. The nuances of taxes, the corporate governance that you mentioned, can make a difference. If we thought corporate governance was far inferior to here, we'd have to make an adjustment for that fact. But I would say that in most of the major countries, the countries that have stock markets that are big enough so we could take a real position, it's a possibility that we would invest in any of them. We wouldn't rule out, you know, Japan, Germany, France, England, the major markets. Now, it's important to recognize in the all the world's stock markets, something like 53% of the value is in the US market. I mean, here we have 4.5% of the world's population. But 53% of the value of all public is represented with companies in the US market. So we are a big part of the pie. But we're very willing to look at almost all the rest of the pie as long as we're talking about markets that are big enough to let us put real money into them. Charlie? Well, so far we haven't done much and Barnett said, but we don't have a rule against it."
"I'm a stockholder from St. Louis, Missouri Appreciate hearing your comments on publicly held companies using their cash for dividends versus stock buybacks","Well, we the equation is pretty simple, but the practice doesn't necessarily follow logic the It's obviously as long as you're telling the truth your shareholders about what's going on so that you aren't manipulating a stock downward or something When a stock can be bought well below its business value Uh, that probably is the best use of cash. It's something the Washington Post did on a huge scale Back in the 1970s Teladine may have bought 90% or something that are close to it of their stockback And that was the reason a very significant percentage of companies bought stock back in the past because they actually thought it was selling for less than it was worth Uh, like I say that that can be abused if you do various things to bury your stock in one way or another but but that wasn't the usual case um It Stock repurchases were relatively unpopular in those days They become quite popular now and and to the extent that I've been around a good number of them and And been able to pick up on what I thought was the underlying rationale if not the professed rationale You know, I think it's often done for people that That are hoping that it causes their Their stock price not to go down and uh and they're and often done at prices that don't really make a lot of sense for continuing shareholders um, if we wanted to Return a bunch of Cash to shareholders. We would if our stock was undervalued we would we would uh We would go to the shareholders and say we think it's cheap and and we think that this cash can be better used by you than by us and we will therefore have Repurchasing at what we think is a discount intrinsic value and the people that remain will be better often the people to get out will get out of a little bit better price than they would otherwise um In terms of dividends you get into an expectational situation And for most companies that follow a that pay a cash dividend It doesn't make sense to be To bounce around the dividend from year to year although private companies frequently do that And we do it ourselves with our subsidiaries they some some subsidiary can pay us a lot of money one year and not so much money the next year uh, but with public companies People do a lot of people do buy stocks to obtain dividends and they hope for regularity and if there's a signaling aspect to it and everything so I would I would say that once you establish a dividend policy with a public company you should think a long time Before you change that policy in a material way But I think the best use of cash if you don't have a good use for it in the business If the stock is underpriced is to repurchase it and if it's overpriced you got no business buying in a single share But a lot of companies do it Charlie Yeah, the dividends are a very interesting subject If you can't be unnecessary stock trading and the cost of investment advice and the cost of making a lot of errors and the Trading costs ending out I don't think would be too extreme to say that now The total amount that spade out in dividends is roughly equal to the amount that is wasted in all this trading and investment advice so that The net dividends that come to the shareholders are approximately zero This is a very peculiar way to run a republic and Very few people comment about it Yeah, actually I did in an article sometime ago and fortune I did the fictional cost To American shareholders in sort of changing shares Uh For all American businesses a whole those fictional costs are probably not much different than the entire amount paid out by American corporations, so uh, but Getting to the individual corporation level a company that expects to regularly Earn more than it then it can profitably employ in its business should be paying out dividends Take a subsidiary of ours like seized candy. We would love to expand seized candy to double or triple its present size But it doesn't work. We've tried it a lot of different ways. So it should be paying out of turnings If it was a public company and it was at one time You know, you could argue that something approaching a 100% payout wouldn't would make sense there, but most management's worrying about Erning's falling off at some time in the future would rather establish a lower level and and and and therefore ensure regularity of dividends Uh, by by going with with a conservative level I You know, we it's obviously something we think about at Berkshire when we have 30 odd billion dollars around if we can't figure out a way to employ that over time You know, it's it's a mistake to keep it in corporate form but We have this expectation and I think it's a reasonable expectation that we get to Put it to work if we ever came to the indifferent conclusion If our stock we thought our stock was significantly undervalued we'd probably figure in terms of Dispersing it through repurchases particularly where now dividends and capital gains are our neutral for for individuals uh, and um If our stock was not underpriced and we thought we would we would probably do something by a dividend It's not going to happen soon"
"Both Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger have addressed my question in annual reports and at previous meetings here. This is my first time. It has to do with investment in a few great high technology stocks. I know your answer has been that if you don't understand it, I can't after this performance can't really believe that both of you don't understand most of the high technology questions. But I'm thinking about not only Microsoft, but say Pfizer and J and J. All three companies which have already proven that not only have a great product, proven management over 10 to 15 years, great market share positions which are not easy to get into. And I frankly don't see a big difference in the PE ratios for example, you just say Coca-Cola or you know, Johnson Johnson or Pfizer which are very powerful companies. I wonder if either of both of you would address that question again. Probably wouldn't you?","If you have something you think you understand, it looks very attractive to you. We think it's smart to do what you understand. If we'd been unable to find companies that fit our slender talents, we well might have been in the Pfizer's and Microsoft's and so forth, but we'd never had to revert to it. We don't snare at it. Other people with more talent have found that a wonderful course of action. We generally look at businesses, we feel change is likely to work against this. We do not have great ability, we do not think we have great ability to predict where change is going to lead. We think we have some ability to find businesses where we don't think change is going to be very important. At a Gillette, the product is going to be better 10 years from now than now or 20 years from now than 10 years from now. You saw those earlier ads going back to the blue blade and all that. The blue blade seemed great at the time, but the shaving technology gets better and better. You know that Gillette, although they had that little experience with Wilkinson in the early 60s, but you know that Gillette is basically going to be spending many multiples, the money on developing better shaving systems than exist now compared to anyone else. You know they got the distribution system, they got the believability. If they bring out a product and they say this is something that men ought to look at, men look at it. They found out here a few years ago that same thing happened when they said to women to look at it in the shaving field. They wouldn't have that same credibility someplace else, but in the shaving field they had it. Those are assets that can't be built and they're very hard to destroy. So change, we think we know in a general way what the soft drink industry or the shaving industry, what the candy business is going to look like 10 or 20 years from now. We think Microsoft is a sensational company run by the best of managers, but we don't have any idea what that world is going to look like in 10 or 20 years. If you're going to bet on somebody that is going to see out and do what we can't do ourselves, I'd rather bet on Bill Gates than anybody else, but that I don't want to bet on anybody else. I mean in the end we want to understand ourselves where we think a business is going. And if somebody tells us the business is going to change a lot in Wall Street, they love to tell you that that's great opportunity. They don't think it's a great opportunity when Wall Street itself is going to change a lot incidentally. But it's a great opportunity. We don't think it's an opportunity at all. I mean, it scares the hell out of us because we don't know how it's going to change. We are looking, when people are chewing, chewing gum, we have a pretty good idea of how they chewed it 20 years ago and how it's chewing 20 years from now. We don't really see a lot of technology going into the art of the chew. So that, and as long as we don't have to make those other decisions, why in the world should we? You know, if I had all kinds of things we don't know. And so why go around trying to bet on things we don't know when we can bet on the simple things? So in one, I can see the shareholders like us sticking, I can't say it with a simple one, so they understand us."
"I heard your response to the question regarding Coca-Cola. In the annual report a few years back, you described Coca-Cola in Gillette as the two Invincibles. With Pepsi as a strong competitor today, do you still continue to view Coca-Cola as the Invincible? Additionally, with respect to American Express Company, with last year's financial results at American Express, how do you now view American Express?","I think the term I used was inevitable, but it's very close to the same thing. I did not extend them to the corporate portfolio, particularly in the case of Gillette, but to the Blaine-Razer business. Gillette now has 71% by value of the Blaine-Razer business in the world. I mean, 71% here's a product that everybody knows what it does. They know what it's sold. They know that it's a high margin business. I mean, it isn't like the world or the capitalist world is unaware of the money that could be made if they could knock off Gillette, but they can't knock off Gillette. It's 71%. That's a little higher percentage than what I wrote about it. Actually, Coca-Cola's worldwide market share is a little higher now than it was when I wrote that five years ago. I would say that five or ten years from now I would be amazed if Gillette or Coca-Cola has lost market share in their respective fields. Coca-Cola sells half roughly of the soft drinks in the world and soft drink consumption per capita goes up basically every year. And the capital has gone up every year also. So you get these gains. Maybe they're 3% or 5% in units or 4%, 5% in the first quarter, but it was poor than that. I think it was 3% last year, but when you have half the world and the world's population is growing at a little under 2%, and you're getting 3% or 4% from something that's just pervasive as soft drinks, you're doing all right. And it was crazy, in my view, for people to think that earnings can grow 15 or 18% a year in a business where units where you have half the world's business and units are going to grow fine, but they're not going to grow anything like 15 or 12% or 10%. The Coca-Cola business has done fine. People want crazy in terms of valuing some of these businesses a few years back and I think we had some cautionary language in there generally about the valuations at which the business is sold. And businesses, 71% in Blazor, said that is a, there's some countries where it's 90. In the US, it's also about about 70%. Those are huge market shares of something people use every day. In this country, it's a little over 8 ounces per day, more like well, it's actually more like 9.5 ounces per day, for every man, woman and child in the United States out of the 64 ounces they drink. Well, you're not going to have galloping percentage increases from that arena, but the company's made basically good progress. People got carried away from the stock and I, with the stock and I would argue that they may have gotten encouraged a little bit too much by not only Wall Street, but even by company pronouncements in terms of attainable, possibly attainable gains. There aren't large companies, there, you know, there may be one someplace somehow very large now that could will grow at 15 or 18% a year, but it just isn't in the cards in the world. And we don't want anybody to think Berkshire could do that either because we can't do it from a very large base, the world doesn't allow that. But it does allow making reasonable progress and certainly coca and gelette in those areas where I said they were inevitable and done very well, they haven't. The gelette has not done as well with acquisitions as is clear of a, I mean, the duracel, the gelette acquisition of duracel resulted in giving 20% of the business for another business and that business has not done nearly as well as he did the management or the investment bankers thought it was going to do at the time the deal was made trying. Well, I would say regarding that last instance that that's the normal result. When you try and you've got a wonderful business and you as you share is on it to buy another business, I say at least two times out of three, it's a terrible idea. Geico is a great example Geico is a wonderful business. Absolutely wonderful. Get more wonderful by the day has the world's best manager Tony isely running it. Geico in the last 20 years went into three, at least three other insurance businesses that I can think up they went into resolute insurance, which was a re insurance operation started in the mid 80s. It was a disaster. They went into two others, southern something or other another one that started with an am they I don't know why in the hell they would go into them I mean they had a great great insurance business and there aren't that many great insurance businesses and neither one of those amounted anything I think there's you know they sold them off at some point. But why would you have an absolutely wonderful business and start one and buy two others that are obviously mediocre where you bring nothing to the party but management. It's very human to want to do that it's no it's no great sin that the guy go management did it because we see it happen time after time after time. I can tell you this Charlie and I have no urges like that I mean we want to buy easy things we do not have to prove our manhood by doing something terribly difficult and I think a lot of management steal that necessity they've got a wonderful business at the cigarette companies that cigarette companies at these great businesses and you know they it irritated them that they they like to think they were business genius and so they would go out and buy other things and those other businesses generally did not do that well. I'm not saying they should have been in the cigarette business in the first place but they were not business geniuses because they got to make a lot of money selling an addictive you know product that did not make them business geniuses and so they wanted to prove it other ways and they bought businesses and fell on their face in many cases. Charlie do you have any more add on cigarette coming. No but I think a lot of people rise to the top and in public we held corporations. It's natural to assume once you're sitting in the top chair that now you know pretty much everything or at least how to get wisdom out of this wonderful staff and all these outside advisors that are now available to you and so I think it's very natural at perfectly terrible acquisition decisions get made. I'd say more often than not."
When you are estimating a growth rate on a company I'm at a very predictable company I imagine you apply a big margin of safety to it. What kind of rate do you generally apply? I mean high single digits? In the margin of safety? What kind of growth rate would you on a predictable company might you stay by that?,We are willing to buy companies and aren't going to grow at all. So we get enough for our money when we do it. So we are not looking at checking numbers out as to what kind of cash we think we'll get back over time. Would you rather have a savings if you're going to put a million dollars in a savings account would you rather have something that paid you 10% a year and never change or would you rather have something that paid you 2% a year and increased to 10% a year? You can work out the math to answer those questions but you can you can certainly have a situation where there's absolutely no growth in a business and it's a much better investment than some company that's going to grow at very substantial rates particularly if they're going to need capital in order to grow. There's a huge difference in the business that grows and requires a lot of capital to do so and the business that grows and doesn't require capital and I would say that generally financial analysts do not give adequate weight to the to the difference in those. In fact it's amazing how little attention is paid to that. Believe me if you're investing you should pay a lot of attention to it. Charlie? I agree with that but it's fairly simple but it's not so simple it can all be explained in one sentence. Some of our best businesses that we don't out right don't grow but they they throw off lots of money which we can use to buy something else and therefore our capital is growing without physical growth being in the business and we are much better off being in that kind of a situation being in some business that itself is growing but it takes up all the money in order to grow and doesn't produce that high returns as we go along. A lot of management stone understand that very well actually.
"In response to an earlier question, you spoke of people being rich and very, very rich. It seems to me there's a difference between being rich and being wealthy. I assume you consider yourself to be both. Which is the more important to you?","Well I think we may ask you to define, I don't want to sound like President Clinton here too much, but we've asked it. If you really define the rich and wealthy so that I get the distinction, then I think we can give you a better abstraction on it. Well in my mind being rich is having an awful lot of money, being very, very rich is having even more. And being wealthy doesn't necessarily equate to having a lot of money. What does it equate to then? I think I know what you mean, but I still want you to clear it up before I give you an answer on it. Well this of course is my opinion. I mean you can be wealthy and health for example, and I agree with you that certainly there'd be nothing you'd value more than good health for yourself and your family. But you go ahead. Well I believe you're starting to get it. Have patience. No there's no question about it. The money makes very little difference after a moderate level. I tell this to college students that I talk to. We eat the same foods. There's no important difference in our dress. There's no difference in the television set that we sit there and watch the Super Bowl on or anything of the sort. There's really no difference in, you know, they've got air conditioning and summer and I've got air conditioning, I've got heat and winter. Almost everything. So any importance in daily life, we equate out. The one thing I do is I travel a lot better than they do. Net jets. So the travel is travel I do a lot easier than they do. Everything else in their lives, it just, you know, I'll switch places anytime. It doesn't make any difference. Then you get down to the things of health and who loves you. And that, you know, there's nothing. If you have a minimum level of, I mean you want to have enough so that you eat three times a day and that you sleep in reasonably comfortable surrounding and so on. Everybody in this room has that and yet some of the people by the definition that you've given are obviously much more wealthy than others and it's not measured by their net worth. If you define it that way and I don't disagree with that definition, I wouldn't, I might not use the term wealth and describing it. But that certainly just, you know, maybe call it well being or something of the sort. Charlie. He's thinking. Sure, there are a lot of things in life way more important than wealth. All that said, some people do get confused. I play golf with a man. He says, but good is helped. You can't buy money with it. I'll take health any time. I'll take health any time. The important thing even in your work is doing a extreme extent. If you're going to spend eight hours a day working, the most important thing is how much money you make is how you feel during those eight hours in terms of the people you're interacting with and how interesting what you're doing is and all of that. I consider myself incredibly lucky in that respect. I can't think of anything I'd rather do and I can't think of any group of people I'd rather do it with. And if you ask me to trade away a very significant percentage of my net worth either for some extra years or being able to do during those years, what I want to do, you know, I do it in a second."
"From time to time, you have coated John Maynard gains the British economies. So I would assume that you have read with investment writing very extensively. What are two or three investment relations in your opinion one can learn from that economist?","Well, I forget which, I think it's chapter 8 of the general theory. Remember Charlie or the Gem? No. There's one chapter in the general theory that relates to markets and the psychology of markets and the behavior, market participants, and so on. But probably aside from Ben Graham's two chapters, 8 and 20 in the intelligent investor, I think you'll find, to get as much wisdom from reading that as anything written in investments. And you'll know it when you see it in the general theory. It's chapter that jumps out to you about the securities and so on. And I could be chapter 8, but I may be wrong in that. But I would recommend reading that. Cames and Graham from vastly different starting points came to the same conclusion at about the same time in the 30s as to the soundest way to invest over time. They differed some on their ideas on diversification. Cames believed in diversifying far less than that Graham. But Cames started off with the wrong theory, I would say, in the 20s and essentially tried to predict business cycles and markets and then shifted to fundamental analysis of businesses in the 30s and did extremely well. And about the same time Graham was writing his first material, I think Janet Lowen or book on Ben Graham actually has a little correspondence that took place between Cames and Ben. So I would advise you to read that."
"A couple of questions, one serious one, not quite. Considering Berkshire Hathaway is well run at low cost and is diversified, why should anyone do anything but put all their money into Berkshire Hathaway instead of maintaining a diversified portfolio and in some of these patriographic kind of biographies, as a parent that you have other investments yourself, the arm Berkshire Hathaway. The second question I had is there any significance to the fact that the Omaha World Herald does not include Berkshire Hathaway and its stock tables on any day? Is this a sign that they do not honor prophets?","No, they actually have a separate little table called Midlands, I think it's entitled Midlands Investment, but they pick out about 50 stocks that are a particular interest to people in this area and they lift those from the regular table and put it in this separate table, which is usually on a second page right following the main stock table. So they give us our just do on that, but you should look in a different table for that. The second question about putting all your money in, I've got 99% of my money in Berkshire Hathaway, but it was born at a different price. And Charlie's was born a little cheaper too, I think. So we like the idea of having it all in there, but we don't recommend that people do that because you will get very low cost management. What we hope is that from this point forward that that cost does not reflect its value, but the price at which you enter is very important. You do get a great group of businesses, you get a lot of great operating managers, you get very reasonable costs. But that is fairly widely recognized now compared to the past and people pay more for it than they used to it. I'm still very comfortable with it and I think Charlie's comfortable with it too, but everyone has to make up their own mind about price, Charlie. Yeah, eventually if the success continues and we have more of this agiography, the stock will get such a high price that it's no longer sensible at all to buy. We hope we dampen that process as we go along. And of course there's always the very substantial chance that we'll just fail to meet expectations due to the persistitudes of life. Falling on our faces is what we call it."
He wanted to know what business school.,"Oh, business schools. Yeah, well, I would say this that I think Bruce Greenwald's class at Columbia is very good. He gets in a lot of people that are practitioners. So there's a lot of practicality to the course. And I think Bruce is good. He's got to do a book coming out that probably within the next six months or so that we'll deal with that. And then there also has been a endowed at the University of Florida. Certain courses relating to value investing. And I think there's been one at the University of Missouri. So I would suggest you at least check out the curriculum at the University of Missouri in Columbia and Florida and do a little comparison and maybe check with a few graduates. Recent graduates as to what kind of experience they had. I think you can find them. I think that's the best system for evaluating a place. But those three at least have courses that based on the catalog sound like they might be of interest to you. Charlie? Yeah. A huge majority of the business school teaching on the field of investment, passive portfolios of securities is not what we believe and not what Warren was taught years ago by Ben Graham. They're just little pockets of our attitude left. There's one at Stanford, Jack McDonald. Yeah, sure. And that's graduate school. He's a graduate school. And what's interesting about that is I think it's the most popular course in the whole Stanford business school. They've got some kind of a bidding system. And yet I asked Jack how he felt. And he said he felt lonely. He's got the most popular course. But in the whole professoriate dealing with investment matters, the Jack McDonald's are a little clan of their own in a side pocket, so to speak. Now they're right, and they can take whatever consolation they get from that. But mostly if you go to a business school, you will learn a lot of things we don't believe. Jack, Bob Kirby comes in and works with Jack sometimes, too. And Bob has got a terrific mind in terms of investment. So there's no question about that. It's not the easiest school in the world to get into. And it is at the graduate level. But there are these occasional anomalies, as they would say, in the teaching world. I mean, what you really want a course on investing to be is how to value a business. That's what the game is about. I mean, if you don't know how to value a business, you don't know how to value a stock. And if you look at what is being taught, I think you see very little of how to value a business. And the rest of it is playing around maybe with numbers or Greek symbols or something of the sort. But it doesn't do you any good. I mean, in the end, you have to decide whether you're going to value a business at $400 million or $600 million or $800 million. And then you compare that with the price. And that's what investing is. And I don't know any other kind of investing, basically, to do. And that just isn't taught. And the reason it isn't taught is because there are teachers around who do know how to teach it. I mean, they don't know themselves. And since they don't know themselves, they teach something that says nobody knows anything. And which is the efficient market theory. And if I didn't know how to do it, if I ever teach physics, I'm going to come up with a theory that nobody knows anything. Because it's the only way I can get through the day. But it's fascinating to me how the really great universities operate in this respect. If you get a sacred writ, I mean, you get in the finance department because you sign on to whatever the present group thinks. And if they think the world is flat, you better think the world is flat too. And your students better answer the world's flat when they get on exams. I would say investment finance teaching in this country is in general is kind of pathetic. Well, I think the business schools do a pretty good job when it comes to accounting or personnel management or a whole lot of subjects, I think they do quite well with. But they miss one enormous opportunity. If you learn to think intelligently about how to invest successfully in businesses, you'll become a much better business manager than you will if you aren't good at understanding what's required for successful investment. So they're missing a huge opportunity to improve the management profession by doing such a lousy job in teaching investment. Yes, Charlie and I see CEOs all the time who, in a sense, don't know how to think about the value of businesses that are acquiring. And then, so they got in higher investment bankers. And guess what? The investment banker tells them what to do. They tell them to do it because they get 20 access. They do it and access if they don't do it. And guess how the advice comes out. So it's one a manager of a business feels helpless, which he won't say out loud, but inwardly, feels helpless in the question of asset allocation. He's got a real problem. And they have not gone to business schools that have given them any real help, I think, in terms of learning how to think about valuation and businesses. And that's one of the reasons that we write and talk about at some because there's a gap there."
"I've got a theoretical value question for you. If you were to buy a business and you bought it at its intrinsic value, what's the minimum after tax free cash flow yield you'd need to get? Your question is if we were buying all of a business and we were buying it at what we thought was intrinsic value, what was the minimum present earning power or what the minimum discount rate of future streams? No, what's the minimum current after tax free cash flow yield you'd need to get?","We could conceivably buy a business I don't think we would be likely to but we could conceivably buy a business that had no current after tax cash flow but we would have to think it was had a tremendous future but we would not find obviously the current figures particularly in the kind of businesses we buy tend to be representative we think of what's going to happen in the future but that would not necessarily have to be the case. You can argue for example in buying stock at a time when it was losing significant money. We didn't expect it to continue to lose significant money but if we think the present value of the future earning power is attractive enough compared to the purchase price we would not be overwhelmed by what the first year's figure would be. Charlie, do you want to add to that? Yeah, we don't care what we report in the first year or two of after buying anything. Well, I would say that in a world of 7% long-term bond rates that we would certainly want to think we were discounting future after tax streams of cash at least a 10% rate but that will depend on the certainty we feel about the business. The more certain that we feel about a business the closer we are willing to play it. We have to feel pretty certain about any business before we're even interested at all but there are still degrees of certainty and if we thought we were getting a stream of cash over the next 30 years that we felt extremely certain about we would use a discount rate that would be somewhat less than if it was one where we thought we might get some surprises in five or 10 years when the possibility existed."
Do you think gambling companies will have a great future? Thank you.,"A kind of capital? Gambling company. Gambling companies will have a terrific future if they're legal. Which ones or anything I don't know anything about that. But desire of people to gamble. And they gamble in stocks incidentally too. Day trading I would say very often was, came very close to gambling as defined. But people like to gamble. You know what I mean? That's if the Super Bowl is on or even in what better yet if a terribly boring football game is on. But you don't have anything to do. And you're sitting here with somebody else you're probably going to enjoy the game more. If you've had a few bucks on it one way or the other. As you know, I mean we ensure hurricane. So I watch the weather channel. But that's a. It can be exciting. But people the the human propensity to gamble is is huge. Now when it was legalized only in pretty much in Nevada. He had to go to some distance or break some laws to do any serious gambling. But as the states learn to. You know what a great source of of the revenue it was. They gradually made it easier and easier and easier for people to gamble and believe me the easier it's made. The more people will gamble. I mean when I was. But my my children are here and 40 years ago. I bought a slot machine and I put it up on our third floor. And I could give my kids any allowance they wanted as long as it was in dimes. I mean I had it all back by nightfall. I thought I would be a good lesson for him. Now they weren't going to Las Vegas to do it but believe me when it was on the third floor they could find it. You know and my payout ratio was terrible too but that's the kind of father I was. The but gambling you know people are always going to want to do it. And for that reason I particularly think that access. You know in terms of friendly gambling like that I'm not approved about it. But I do think that to quite an extent gambling is a tax on ignorance. I mean if you want to if you want to tax the ignorant people who will do things with the odds against them. You know you just put it in and guys like me don't have to pay taxes and I really don't I find that. I find it kind of socially revolving when a government a government prays on the weaknesses of its citizenry rather than acts to serve them. And believe me when a government six light. When a government makes it easy for people to take their social security checks and start pulling handles. Or participating in a lot of research or whatever it may be. It's a pretty cynical act. It works. It's a pretty cynical act. And it it it it it it released taxes on those. You know who don't fall for those and or who don't I want dreaming about having a car instead of actually having a car dreaming about a color TV instead of having one. So it's it's not government at his best and I think other things flow from that over time too. Charlie. Yeah I would argue that the gambling casinos use clever psychological tricks to cause people to hurt themselves. They're undoubtedly a lot of harmless amusement in the casinos but there's also a lot of grief as entry that is deliberately caused by the casinos. It's a dirty business and I don't think you'll find a casino soon in Berkshire Hathaway."
"I have a question of the annual report where you say that obviously going forward due to the size of Berkshire, the returns going forward probably won't master returns to the past. And then you go on to state that one thing that may hinder that is the fact that you don't really like to sell companies that you own. And I would just like to know what the reasoning is in that if you've got a company or investment that you don't think is going to do as well as where you can put the money going forward, what really the reasoning is for holding on and not redeploying the money elsewhere.","I'll just correct you just slightly. I didn't say we'd probably do worse than the past. I say we will do worse than the past. I mean, there's no way we could match percentage numbers of the past. And we would, in a period that would not take that long, we would, assuming we paid out nothing, we would gobble up the whole GDP, which is something we may think about occasionally. But I don't really expect to accomplish the, but, and the second point that that relates to size, that does not relate to our unwillingness to sell businesses because that unwillingness is existed for decades. But the size is not existed for decades. The size is doubling, doubling 12 billion or so is harder than doubling 1 billion, 2, which was harder than doubling 120 million. I mean, there's no question about that. So eventually, well, already, it will be a drag on performance. It doesn't mean that performance will be terrible, but it does mean that 23% is an historical figure that has no predictive value. The unwillingness to sell businesses, like I say, goes, goes back a long way. That is not what, that, that, that, that, that hurts performance. It's peanuts. That's simply a fact of, a, a function of, of the attitude, Charlie, and I have is that if we want to live our lives, we find it, we find it, errrarity when we find people in the business that we want to associate with. When we do find that, we enjoy it. We don't see any reason to make an extra half a percent a year or one percent a year. Don't try us on higher numbers, but the, the, the, we don't, we don't see a reason to, to go around, ending, ending friendships we have with people or contact or relationships. It just doesn't make any sense to us. We don't want to, we don't want to get committed to that sort of activity. We know we wouldn't do it if we were a private company. Now, in Berkshire, we feel we've, an unciated that position. We want to get that crossed everybody who might join with us because we don't want them to expect us to do it. We, we want to expect us to work hard to get a decent result and to make sure that the shareholders get the same result we get and all of that sort of thing. But we don't want to enter into any implicit contract with our fellow shareholders that will cause us to have to behave in a way that we really, we don't want to behave. If, if that's the price of making more money, it's a price we don't want to pay. There's other things we, other things we forego also. But that is the one that people might disagree with us on. But we want to be very sure that everybody understands that going in. That's, that's part of what you buy here and it may, I don't think it'll hurt performance that much anyway. But to the extent it does, it's, it's, it's a limitation you get with us. Try. I don't think there's any way to measure it exactly. But my guess is that if you, if you could, I pray something, you might call the character of the people that are running the operating businesses in Berkshire, many of whom helped create the businesses in the first place and are leading citizens in their community like the Hillsburgs. I don't think there's any other corporation in America that's done as well as we have. If you measure the human quality of the people, we're in it. Now, you can say we've collected high-grade people because we sure as hell couldn't create them. But one way or another, this is a remarkable system. And why would we tinker with it? If you want to, if you want to attract high-grade people, you probably ought to try and behave pretty well yourself. I mean, it's just, it's just, besides it, it wouldn't be any fun doing the other. I mean, I was in that position a little bit when I ran the partnership back in the 60s. And I really, people were coming into partnership with me and my job was to turn out the best return that we could. And I found that if I got into a business that presented certain alternatives that I didn't like. So Berkshire's a much more satisfactory in that respect."
"My husband and I will have some new money in the early 80s of our life. We have a daughter 50 years or Lula in here at anything we have. My question is, I also have a 4% interest on a mutual fund that is non-taxable. Are there any better ways to invest our money?","Those are tough questions. I run into friends of mine all the time where they come into a lump sum at a given time. Charlie and I do not have great answers about investing some of money. For people who are not really active in the process, if we were working with small sums now we would start looking at a whole bunch of small situations and some things that we might know how to do on a small scale. For the average investor, we want to invest in some kind of very low cost pool of money which might well be an index fund that makes as much sense as anything. It is important to keep the cost down. I have close to 100% of my net worth and I am comfortable with it because I like the businesses we own. I did not buy it at this price either. I do not like to go. I never recommend anybody buy or sell it. Charlie do you recommend anything? I think it is anybody in the room who thinks it would be very easy to come up with a one-liner for a great no-brainer investment tomorrow with a great slug of no money. I wish they would come up and tell me what it is. We do not have any solution to that one. It is harder for us now than it has been at other times. There have been a couple of times in 1974. There was something in Forbes and 1969 the reverse of that situation. I wrote an article for Forbes that can not remember exactly when it was about how equity is almost had to be more attractive than bonds at that time and bonds are not that unattractive. Every now and then you can say you are getting a great deal for your money in equities or sometimes you can say you are getting a great deal for your money and fixed income investments. You can't say that now. We find ourselves sitting and waiting for something and we continue to look. We are forced to look at bigger ideas. If we were working with smaller funds we would be much more likely to find something than we are in our present situation. Charlie says we really do not have any great one-line advice on it. I wish we did. We have a real long-term rate of return from saving money and investing it has to go down from recent experience in America, particularly equity related, recent experience. The wealth of the world can't increase at the kind of rates that people are used to in the American equity markets. They are going to equity markets can't hugely outperform the growth of the world forever. We ought to have reduced expectations regarding the future of general. We mentioned earlier 53% of the world stock market value is in the US. If US GDP grows at 4% or 5% a year with 1% or 2% inflation, which would be a very good result. I think it's very unlikely that corporate profits are going to grow at a greater rate than that. Corporate profits is a percent of GDP and on the high side already. You can't constantly have corporate profits grow at a faster rate than GDP. Obviously in the end they'd be greater than GDP. It's like somebody said that New York has more lawyers than people. There are certain conflicts in terminologies. If you say profits can get bigger than GDP. If you really have a situation where the best you can hope for in corporate profit growth over the years is 4% or 5%. How can it be reasonable to think that equities which are a capitalization of that corporate profits can grow at 15% a year? It is nonsense frankly. People are not going to average 15% or anything like it in equities. I would almost defy them to show me mathematically how it can be done in aggregate. I looked the other day at the Fortune 500 there and $334 billion on it and had a market cap of 9.9 trillion at the end of the year, which would probably be at least 10.5 trillion now. The only money investors are going to make in the long run are what the businesses make. There is nothing added. The government doesn't throw in anything. Nobody is adding to the pot. People are taking out from the pot in terms of frictional costs, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and all of that. The $334 million is all the investment earns. If you want to farm, what the farm produces is all you are going to get from the farm. If it produces $50 an acre of net profit, you get $50 an acre of net profit. If you own all of the Fortune 500, you own 100% of us, you would be making $334 billion. If you pay $10.5 trillion for that, that is not a great return on investment. Then you say yourself, can that double in five years? It can't double in five years. With GDP growing at 4% a year or some number like that, it would just produce things that are so out of whack in terms of experience in the American economy. Any time you get involved in these things where if you trace out the mathematics of it, you bump into absurdities, then you better change expectations so much. There are two great sayings. One is, if a thing can't go on forever, it will eventually stop. The other I borrowed from my friend Fred Stanbach, I think, is here. People who expect for petriule growth in real wealth and a finite earth are either madmen or economists. Don't fall for a place."
"Everybody in this room's got to be wondering the same question. Who in your opinion, both of you, is the next Warren Buffett? Charlie, who's the next Charlie Munger? Let's try that first.","That's a more difficult question. There's not much demand. I don't think there's only one way to succeed in life, and our successors in Duke time may be different in many ways. And they may do better. Incidentally, we have a number of people in the company, some of whom are in this room today, and the ones you saw on that screen, who are leagues ahead of Charlie and me in various kinds of abilities. There's a lot of different talents. We've got the best bridge player in the world. Charlie and I could work night and day, and if he spent 10 minutes a week working on it, he'd play better bridge than we would. And all kinds of intellectual endeavors. For some reason or another, one person's a little bit better wired for than someone else. And we have people running our businesses that, Charlie and I were put in charge of those businesses, we couldn't do remotely as well as they do. There's a lot of different talents. The two that we're responsible for is keep able people who are already rich, motivated to keep working at things where they don't need to do it for financial reasons. I mean, it's that simple. And that's a problem. Many of you could think about. And you'd probably be quite good at it if you gave a little thought, because you'd figure out what would cause you to work if you were already rich and didn't need the job. Why would you jump out of bed and be excited about going to work that day? And then we try to apply that to the people who work with us. Secondly, we have to allocate capital. And these days, we have to allocate a lot more capital than we had to allocate a decade ago. That job is very tough at present. Sometimes it's very easy. And it will be easier times in the future. And it'll be difficult at times in the future. But there are other people that can allocate capital. And we have, we have, we have them in the company."
"I'll be graduating from Harvard College in June and beginning a career in value investing. So I sure hope we're all right in thinking that this censure will be just as good as the last for value investors. You've been doing this since you were my age, if not younger. So I'm wondering what habits or habits have contributed most to your ability to continue learning and improving your investment decisions in a changing business and financial environment?","I would say that at least in my case, I haven't been continually learning in terms of the basic principles. You always learn a little more about given techniques or we learn, you know, I learn more about some industries over time and therefore maybe I've widened the universe in which I can operate all the more funds narrows it back down unfortunately. But I know more about businesses than I knew 20 years ago or 40 years ago. I haven't really changed the principles. The last change, the basic principles are still been Graham. They were affected in a significant way by Charlie and Bill Fisher in terms of looking at the better businesses. But I didn't leave any of, I didn't leave Graham behind on that. And I really haven't learned any new fundamental principles. But I may have learned a little bit more about how business operates over time. And there's really nothing. I mean, you ought to get an investment framework that comes straight from, in my view, from the intelligent investor and from Bill Fisher, more from the intelligent investor actually. And then I think you ought to learn everything you can about industries and businesses that where you think you have the ability to get your mind around them if you work at them. And with that arsenal, you'll do very well. And if you've got the temperament for the business, Charlie. Yeah, of course, I've watched, were on all these decades. And he's learned a hell of a lot. Even the last 20 or 30 years. So it's a game of continuing to learn. And he can denigrate this little fruit food that enables him to pick the biggest oil company in China or this or that. But those basic principles alone that he knew a long time ago wouldn't have given him the ability to make the recent investment decisions as well as he's made them. It's a lifelong game. And if you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. Let me say temperament. So still is the most important. When you're sure I'm in, of course. But temperament alone won't do it. No, temperament alone won't do it. You have to have the temperament and the right basic idea. And then you have to keep at it with a lot of curiosity. For a long, long time. But you don't have to be blindingly and have any blinding insights or have a high IQ to look at a pet for China, for example. No. I mean, it's a company that is doing two and a half million barrels a day. That's 3.5% of the world or 3% of the world's oil production. And they're selling based on US prices, using WTI as a West Texas intermediate, as a base price, and where they have a significant part of the marketing and refining in a country. Attacks rates 30%. They're going to pay out 45% to you in dividends. Don't have unusual amounts of leverage. If you're buying something like that, well under half, maybe a third of what comparable oil companies are selling for. That's not high-level stuff. I mean, you have to read the reports. But I enjoy doing that. But you wouldn't say that requires any high-level insights or anything, Charlie. Well, when you were buying that block of stock, nobody else to speak of was buying. Thank heavens. The insights can't have been all that common. No, I think that takes a certain amount of what an old-home offer and used to call uncommon sense. You used to say there is no common sense. When people say common sense, they mean uncommon sense. Part of it, I think, is being able to tune out folly as distinguished from recognizing wisdom. And if you just got whole categories of things, you just bat away so your brain is enclettered with them, then you're better able to pick up a few sensible things to do. Yeah, we don't consider many stupid things. We get rid of them fast. And in fact, people get irritated with us because they'll call us. And when they're in the middle of the first sentence, we'll just don't forget it. We can see it coming. And that's the way, actually, the mine was. It was a great article in the New Yorker magazine 30 years ago or so. Little more than that. It was one of the Fisher's Sposky chess matches we're going on. It got into the speculation of what the human's being able to take on computers and chess. And here were these computers doing hundreds of thousands of calculations a second. And they said, how can the human mind, when all you're really looking at is the future, the results from various moves in the future, how can a human mind deal with a computer that's thinking it speaks that are unbelievable. And of course, the exam and the subject sum and a mind like, well, in fact, all minds, but some much better than others. But a Fisher's Sposky essentially was eliminating about 99.99% of the possibilities, but not even thinking about it. So it wasn't that they get out think the computer in terms of speed, but they had this ability in what you might call grouping or exclusion. Or essentially, they just got right down to the few possibilities out of these billions of possibilities that really had any chance of success. And getting rid of the nonsense, I mean, just figuring that people start calling you and saying, I've got this great, wonderful idea. Don't spend 10 minutes, once you know in the first sentence that it isn't a great, wonderful idea. Don't be polite. Go through the whole process. Charlie and I are pretty good at that. We can hang up very fast. Oh, there you have it. All you've got to do is go at it in the way that Vasily Svizlov did when he was the world champion and of chess and just do the same thing in investments."
"Early you had acknowledged that it is a more difficult investment and business environment today than it was when you first started out. My question is, if you are starting out again today in your early 30s, what would you do differently or the same in today's environment to replicate your success? In short, Mr. Buffett, how can I make $30 billion?","Start young. Charlie's always said that the big thing about it is we started building this snowball on top of a very long hill. We started early early age and rolling the snowball down. Of course, the nature of compound interest is it behaves like a snowball, sticky snow and the trick is to have a very long hill, which means either starting very young or living very old. I would do it exactly the same way if I were doing an investment world. If I were getting out of school today and I had $10,000 to invest, I would start with the A's. I would start going right through companies and I probably would focus on smaller companies because I would be working with smaller sums and there's more chance that something is overlooked in that arena. As Charlie said earlier, it won't be like doing that in 1951 when you could leave through and find all kinds of things that just leapt off the page at you. That's the only way to do it. You have to buy businesses. You have to buy a little pieces of businesses called stocks and you have to buy them at attractive prices and you have to buy them to buy into good businesses. That advice will be the same 100 years from now in terms of investing. That's what it's all about. You can't expect anybody else to do it for you. People will not tell you about wonderful little investments. It's not the way the investment business is set up. When I first visited Geico in January of 1951, that rest of that year, I subsequently went down to Blython Company and actually to one other firm that was a leading guy or company that was a leading analyst and insurance. I thought I'd discovered this wonderful thing and I'd see what these great investment houses that specialized in insurance stocks said and they said I didn't know what I was talking about. They wasn't of any interest to them. You've got to follow your own, you've got to learn what you know and what you don't know and within the arena, what you know, you have to pursue it very vigorously and act on it when you find it and you can't look around for people to agree with you. You can't look around for people even know what you're talking about. You have to think for yourself and if you do, you'll find things. Charlie? Yeah, the hard part of the process for most people is the first $100,000. If you have a standing start at zero, getting together $100,000 is a long struggle for most people. I would argue that people who get there relatively quickly are helped if they're passionate about being rational, very eager and opportunistic and steadily understand their income grossly. I think those three factors are very helpful."
"Regarding compensation, you have commented along the lines of people willing to bet big on their abilities, usually have a lot to bet on. A mid-American regulatory filing indicated some attractive, prospective compensation possibilities for senior executive team, subject of course to meeting profitability milestones. Perhaps you might provide some details on the thought process that went into crafting that compensation structure and in doing so use this specific example as a reminder about virtue's compensation philosophy related to pay for performance versus the more popular approaches","If it's easier to figure out in a minister, better for owners and can still attract talented people, why don't more companies adopt such practices? You could make a lot of money working for Berkshire, not if you're chairman or vice chairman, but there's a chance to make a lot of money, but it will relate to performance. No one is going to make lots of money at Berkshire for average performance and you've mentioned the mid-American situation. We've got some extraordinary management in mid-American and in terms of how that compensation arrangement was worked out, I was thinking one day about what would be appropriate for the two individuals who are key to the success of mid-American and I took a yellow pad and I spent about three minutes sketching out a proposal and I went to Walters Scott who was our partner in the business and actually heads the complimenting and I said, well, what are these? There's an idea I have, what do you think of it? He looked at it and he said, it looks fine to me and we talked to the two managers about it and actually as we presented it, we had it so that something over 50% went to the CEO Dave Sokol and something under 50% went to the number two man, Greg Able, who's enormously a well-known and when we gave it to David, he said, I like it fine, but let's make it 50-50. That's the extent of it. As you commented, that's wildly different than the approach to companies. Most companies go through a very elaborate procedures and working out executive compensation. I don't think that Charlie and I have spent maybe five minutes on any. On thinking about any, we have an arrangement at C's Candy with Chuck Huggins. We worked it out in 1972. It's still enforced now. John Holland took over a fruit of the loom a couple of years ago. I met with him for a couple of minutes, suggested something, takes up a paragraph or two and that's what we'll have with John, the rest of his life. It's not highly complex. You have to understand the businesses. There is no one formula we could use at Berkshire that would fit across our businesses. That's Asa 9. You don't want them complicated. We don't have anything that goes on for pages and pages. It's not needed. It establishes a relationship between us and the manager that's not good. So all of our stuff is very, very simple. At Geico we have two variables. And they're what count. So we make, from Tony and I, we have everybody participating based on that. We worked that out. Whenever we took over at Geico and it's worked fine since then it'll keep working. But we do not bring in compensation consultants. We don't have a human relations department. We don't have, we don't, the headquarters as you can see. We don't have any human relations department. We don't have a legal department. We don't have a public relations department. We don't have an investor relations department. We don't have those things. Because they make life way more complicated and everybody gets invested interested in going to conferences and calling another consultants. It takes on a life of its own. In the typical large corporation there's a comp committee. And as I pointed out in the past, they don't put dobermans on the comp committee usually. They look for show how I was that have been sedated and I've been on 19 boards. They put me on one committee once and I was chairman and I got out voted. Do you remember that, Shirley? I certainly do. Yeah. It's very fine guys. Yeah, the terrific guys actually. And they, you know, the nature of it is that now particularly with Sarabane's actually, there's lots of committee meetings, the directors meetings are filled up with process. And you have on one side of the tables and people that are usually are spending an hour or two and getting presented with a bunch of material by the human relations department and the, and some outside consultants. And I've never seen that had a human relations department or a consultant come in and say, this is a bozo you've got is only worth about half what you've been paying. And it's just isn't going to happen. So it's a situation where the intensity of interest on both sides is seldom equal. The directors are often dealing with something my friend Tom Murphy in the past is called play money and the CEO is dealing with something very dear to his heart. So you've got to expect the situation like that to get gained over time, not over time, probably actually and there's some change in that that's taking place. But it's not being in my in large part, it's not being led by CEOs and it's difficult for directors to do to get a lot done. They get handed a sheet of paper that shows them comparable elsewhere and everybody thinks they're CEOs in the top 25% or something. And so there's a ratcheting effect that takes place. And now stock options are kind of out of favor. So restricted stock comes in. But the idea is to keep the pie very large for CEOs. And if I needed the money, I'd probably be doing the same thing. Charlie? Well, I would rather throw a viper down my shirt front than hire a compensation consultant. Probably which kind of consultants you actually like,"
Do you have any timetable regarding when you will write your own book about your career and philosophy?,"Yes, my time to have always been six months from now. The answer on that is I thought about doing it a few times and I think about it. It always seems to me there's way more interesting things yet to happen than it happened so far and I don't want to I know I won't write a second one so I keep postponing it. That's my that's my ration to hell out of that."
"question concerns dividends. Last Friday night by coincidence on Lewis Rukaiser's weekly television show, the special guest was Philip Carey and Mr. Carey made the statement that his favorite American stock is Berkshire Hathaway and one of the major reasons he stated was that Berkshire has never paid a dividend as we all know. And consequently you had superior utilization of the extra cash. Now, if you extend that reasoning, could it also be a beneficial policy if Coca-Cola and Gillette stop paying dividends and utilize the cash in other ways?","Well, it depends what they could use that how they would utilize the cash and what they could use it for. Those are more focused enterprises than Berkshire, at least in terms of products. They I think I commend management that have a wonderful business for utilizing cash in those wonderful businesses or in businesses that they understand and will also have wonderful economics and for getting the rest of the money back to the shareholder. So Coca-Cola in my book is doing exactly the right thing with its cash when it both when a it uses all the cash that it can effectively in the business to expand in new markets and all of that sort of thing. But then beyond that, it pays with the dividend which distributes cash to shareholders and then it repursures the shares in a big way which returns cash on a selective basis to shareholders but in a way that benefits all of them. So we you will benefit from us not paying dividends just as long as we can use the every dollar we retain to produce more than a dollar of value and of market value over time. So we can continue doing that, how long we can continue doing that, I can't promise you. But that is the yardstick by which the decision is made. And that is the yardstick by which Coca-Cola is making the decision too and I think that they deserve great credit for exercising the discipline to quit when they use in cash when they run out of the opportunities to use it well and then to use it then the further deploy it advantageously by repurchasing shares. I think one of the things I admire about my friend Bill Gates, he's got 4.5 billion of cash and Microsoft and very few managements can stand having 4.5 billion of cash and not doing something unintelligent with it. So far it's made sense for us to retain everything we earn. And I think it will make sense for a while longer but it may not make sense indefinitely."
"Gentlemen, you have stated many times that Lou Simpson manages the Geico Investment portfolio on an independent and autonomous basis. What unique or superior qualities does Mr. Simpson possess as an investor that is earning this tremendous vote of confidence? Secondly, Berkshire Invest in privately-held businesses, as well as publicly-traded securities, while the skillset required to value public and private businesses may be the same. Does Mr. Simpson also have the additional experience and skills necessary to negotiate a private transaction if caught upon a do so?","Yeah, I think he could, but I hope he doesn't get caught onto very soon. Lou is smart and careful and high-grade and experienced. So, he does manage a couple billion dollars autonomously. He will buy things I won't know about him until I either look at a monthly sheet or sometimes read it in the paper. And that's fine. You know, he doesn't know what I'm doing. I don't know what he's doing. And every now and then we're in the same security, so we try and coordinate if we're buying or selling under those circumstances. And incidentally, you will occasionally read a headline or not a very big headline, but in the financial press that says, Buffett buying a XYZ, well, sometimes it's a Simpson buying XYZ. The reports we file would not necessarily tell the reader which one of us made the decision. Because even if the report showed that something was bought in Geico, that could be bought in by me and placed in Geico for various reasons or conceivably, Lou can buy something and place it in national indemnity or some other Berkshire company for reasons, for also for perfectly good reasons. But some of what gets reported is done by Berkshire is done by Lou entirely independent of me and most of it in terms of dollars is done by me. But Lou's record is just as good as mine. And Lou wouldn't know how to evaluate businesses, whether private negotiations or public securities and what I'm in no hurry to turn it over."
"you said that you de-centralized the operating decisions, but centralized the capital allocation decisions. What kind of staff do you have in Omaha to help you with the capital allocation decisions and the stock selection decisions you make? Or do you and Charlie do that pretty much by yourselves?","We don't have any staff to help us on it. I mean, basically, we tell them to mail all the money to Omaha. And then when we get there, we put our arms around it. And we allocate all the capital ourselves. I mean, that is our job. And we don't feel we should delegate. I mean, we wouldn't do it anyway. Our personalities aren't such that we would delegate our allocating our own money to somebody, letting somebody else allocate our own money. But we feel that's our job. And it's interesting, and I've written about this in the past, that that's an important job for most management. There are some companies where it's not. But it usually is a very important job for most management. And if you take a CEO that's in a job for 10 years, and he has a business that earns, say, 12% on equity, and he pays out a third, that means he's got 8% per year of equity. I mean, when you think of this 10-year in office, how much capital he's allocated, it's an enormous factor over time. And yet, probably relatively few chief executives are either trained for or are selected on the basis of their ability to allocate capital. I mean, they get there through other routes. So I've said it's like somebody playing the panel of their life, and then getting the Carnegie Hall in the Hand of the Violin. I mean, it is a different function than most than the route than the functions that exist along the routes to the CEO's job at most companies. And so many CEOs, when they get there, think they can solve it by either having a staff that does it or by hiring consultants or whatever it may be. And in our view, that's a terrible mistake because it's, if not the key function of the CEO, it's one of two or three key functions that say 80 or 90% of all companies. And if you can't do it yourself, you're going to make a lot of mistakes. You may make a lot of mistakes, even if you do it yourself. But if you wouldn't want anybody in any other position of that importance in the company, essentially saying, I don't know how to do this, so I'm going to have somebody else do it. That's their key responsibility. But that's the way it works in business. And Charlie and I take responsibility for all capital allocation decisions other than just sort of routine expenditures at the operating businesses. And we don't get into those at all. I mean, if our managers are spending three or four million dollars a year on machinery, or one of them is, I mean, a machinery equipment, plants, new leases, we have no review process on that. And we don't have a staff and headquarters. We don't waste the time to do that. We think those people know how to allocate the money that relates to the actual operations of their business. We think in terms of the capital that is generated above that, that that's our job, Charlie and me. Yeah, I would say we have practically nobody at headquarters. You know, one of the reasons Warren shines up so well is, you know, he's being compared to practically nobody. And I might say one interesting one, we're having this meeting, for example. I think there's one person there in the office. I mean, the rest of them are down here helping on the meeting. But here we are. Here we are. Warren and I are selling candy and encyclopedias and so forth. The chief financial officer of Berkshire Havoy is handling the microphones. I mean, this makes Southwest Airlines look like they don't understand. Cost and public. Cost accounting. I mean, it's a very old fashioned place. And by the way, speaking of walking our merchandise, if any of you have safety deposit boxes full of Berkshire Havoy's certificates and have children or grandchildren who don't have world book and print in the house, you are making a very serious error. That is a marvelous thing to have in a house. And the discount only applies today. I think that's right. It is. That is it. It may not be selling too well because of the current vogue for encyclopedias on computers. And by the way, those encyclopedias that are available are inferior compared to world book, which is very user friendly for children. I like it that way myself. And I know. That is one product you really ought to buy. We both use it personally. I keep a set of the office and a set of home. I give away more of that product than any other product that Berkshire Havoy makes in any subsidiary. It's a perfectly fabulous human achievement. The editor thing, that user friendly, with that much wisdom encapsulated. It's a fabulous thing."
"There seem to be great values in the technology sector that meet most of your criteria, philosophy, and investing with the exception of the simplicity criterion. Names like IBM, Microsoft, HP, Intel. Would you ever consider investing in companies in this sector in the future?","Well, the answer is no. It's probably pretty unfortunate because I've been an admirer of Andy Grove and Bill Gates. And I wish I translated that admiration into backing it up with money. But the truth is, I don't know where Microsoft or Intel. I don't know what that world will look like in 10 years. And I don't want to play in a game where I think the other guys have got an advantage over me. And I could spend all my time thinking about technology for the next year. And I wouldn't be the 100,000 to the 10,000 smartest guy in the country in looking at those businesses. So that is a seven or eight foot bar that I can't clear. There are people that can clear it. But I can't clear it. And no matter how I train, I can't clear it. So the fact that there will be a lot of money made by somebody. It doesn't bother me, really. And I mean, there may be a lot of money made by somebody in Cocoa Beans. But I don't know anything about them. And there are a whole lot of areas I don't know anything about. So more power to them. And I think it would be a very valid criticism. If Charlie and I, if it were possible that Charlie and I, and by spending a year working on it, could become well enough informed so that our judgment would be better than other people's. But that wouldn't happen. And it would be a waste of time. It's much better for us to swing at the easy pitches, Charlie. Whatever you think you know about technology, I think I know less. That's probably not true in Sedamny. Charlie has a little more of a, he understands something in the physical world, a lot better than I do."
"My question pertains to price discovery and liquidity. It is a common perception that unless there is adequate liquidity, price discovery is hurt. Now if liquidity helps price discovery, then does it make sense to split the stock of a company which has a low liquidity problem? As a corollary, why do you consider stocks, splits and bonus issues to be bad foreshared holders in the long run?","Stock splits and one else, Charlie? Yes, bonus issues. And what's the relation? I don't get it. He didn't indicate a relation. No. Just as you described. It's just wrong with both. It's two questions. Well, we explained how we think about stocks splits. There's no religious view against them. We don't think companies do them or evil or anything of the sort. We do think we've got the best group of shareholders in the world. And I think that a meeting like this to some extent is evident of it. We've got people that are more in sync, I think, with the policies of the company. We certainly have people who are more long-term in their view of Berkshire or their intentions regarding Berkshire. I think we have people that understand their investment in Berkshire. They're better than Berk. Well, really better than any of their large American corporations. We've got the lowest turnover of any large American corporation. Now, why is that? Well, people can buy stock in any company they want. I mean, you could have bought stock in Berkshire or something else. But there's this self-selection process of who comes in. And there's a self-selection process of the people that just say, you know, that company doesn't interest me. And I would say that people who say they aren't interested in a stock that sells in the thousands of dollars a share, simply because it sells in the thousands of dollars a share, are not as a group, be as intelligent and informed and long-term in their outlook and there's in sync with the policies of management as this group. It's not a killer of a thing, obviously. But it's a sign. It's a symptom of people with a somewhat different attitude toward the stocks they own. Now, somebody is going to, if we have a million and a half class A equivalent share, we have a little more net outstanding, somebody's going to own them all. So it's just a question of who is attracted and who is repelled from your shares. And I think not splitting and some other things we do at Berkshire and a number of other things we do at Berkshire. As attracted a group of shareholders that really come the closest to an investment-oriented group as almost possible in a widely traded and widely available company. And we like the group we've got. We're not looking for the people who think it would be a more attractive stock if instead of selling it 90,000 a share, it sold at $9 a share. Nothing wrong with those people, but they are, if we were choosing partners, we would choose the group we have over the people who think a $9 stock is a wonderful thing. Charlie. Yeah, and I'm the second part of that question. I think the notion which is talked in so much of modern academia that liquidity is this of a tradeable common stock is a great contributor to capitalism. I think that is mostly twaddle. The GNP of the United States grew very good rates long before we had highly liquid markets for common stock. I don't know where people got that silly notion. I think the liquidity gives us these crazy booms which have many problems as well as virtues. And in England, if you'll remember, after the South Sea bubble, England banned tradeable common stocks for decades. It was absolutely illegal to have a company so widely held. You got a liquid market in the shares. And England did find during that period when you didn't have a stock. If you think that liquidity is a great contributor to civilization, why then you probably believe that all of real estate in America, which is relatively ill, it hasn't been developed properly. Kane's actually commented on the perversions brought about by liquidity. But of course, the truth is that the purchase trades on average $50 million or so of stock a day. So very few people are going to have any problem with the purchase of liquidity in the stock. We're trying to create more of them. More people who have this big liquidity problem because they own so much stock."
What's your opinion regarding the subprime market relative to the foreign national market?,"Well, the, you know, the subprime market encouraged by both lenders, intermediaries, and borrowers themselves that resulted in a lot of people buying a lot of houses that they, we didn't want to own or that they can't make payments on for once the normal payments were required. And the people, the institutions, in some cases, of the intermediaries are going to suffer in various degrees. Now, the question is whether it spills over and starts affecting the general economy to a big degree. And I would, my guess would be it's quite severe some places, but my guess would be that if unemployment doesn't rise significantly and interest rates don't move up dramatically, that it will be a, it will be a very big problem for those involved. And some people are very involved, some institutions are very involved. But I don't see it. I think it's unlikely that that factor alone triggers anything of a massive nature in the general economy. I think it, you know, I've looked at several financial institutions. I've looked at their 10 cues and 10 Ks. And I've seen that a very high percentage of the loans they made in the last few years allowed people to make very tiny payments on the mortgages. But of course, those subnormal payments increase principle so that they had to make above average payments later on at some point. And I think that's dumb lending and I think it's dumb borrowing because somebody they're going to make 20 or 30% of their normal mortgage payments the first year is very unlikely to be able to make 110% of their normal mortgage payments a few years later. Those people and those institutions were largely betting on the fact that house prices would just keep going up and really didn't make any difference whether they could make the payments. And that worked for a while until it didn't work. And when it doesn't work, you have an abnormal supply of housing coming on the market similar to what happened in manufactured housing that business were in six or seven years ago. And that changes the whole equation from people on the demand side. You no longer have people thinking they're buying something that's bound to go up. And then you have the supply coming on for the people who were anticipating that before and really don't want to own the asset unless it's going to go up. So you'll see plenty of misery in that field. You've already seen some. And I don't think I don't think it's going to be any huge anchor to the economy, Charlie. Yeah. A lot of what went on was a combination of Sen and Folly. And a lot of it happened because the accounts allowed the lending institutions to show profits on loans where nobody is right. Mine would have showed any profit until the loan had matured into a better condition. And once again, if the accounts lay down on their basic job, why huge excess and Folly is going to come inevitably. And that happened here. The national experience with low interest starter home loans to what I would call the deserving poor has been very good. But the minute you pay a bunch of people high commissions to make loans to the undeserving poor or the overstretched rich, you can get loan losses that are staggering. And I don't see how the people did it and still shaved in the morning because looking back at them was a face that was evil and stupid. You've seen some very interesting figures in the last few months on the number on the percentage of loans where people didn't even make the first or second payment. And there's really that shouldn't happen. That happened incidentally. You had a prelude to this in the manufactured housing industry. I mean in the late 1990s and securitization accentuated the problem because once you had somebody in Grand Island Nebraska selling a mobile home or manufactured home to to someone and they needed a $3,000 down payment and the sale of them was going to get a $6,000 commission. Believe me, you start getting some very strange things going on. Now the person doing that had to borrow the money in Grand Island. The chances are the local banker would have seen what was happening and said, you know, we don't want any of this word. The salesman fakes the down payment and all that. But once you just package those things and securitize them so they get sold through major investment banking houses and sliced up in various tranches and so on. You know, the old the discipline leaves the system and securitization really accentuates that and we have had that in subprime loans just as we had it in manufactured housing six or seven years ago. And like I say, that has not all worked its way to the system. But I don't think it's going to cause huge troubles. Now we do see certain areas of the country where it will be at least a couple of years before real estate recovers. I mean, the overhang is huge compared to normal monthly volume in certain in certain sections and the people that were calling out for loans there are going to get flipped but in a different way."
"I would like to get some more transparency on how you make investment decisions, particularly how you determine intrinsic values. You mentioned that the theoretically correct method is discounted cashflow, but at the same time you point out the inherent difficulties of the methodology. From other books, I see that you use multiples on operating earnings or owner multiples. Your daughter, Mary, in one of her books, describes another methodology where you apply component economics to the value of the equity. Could you give us a bit more transparency, which quantitative approach you use, and how many years out you try to quantify the results of the investments you're interested in?","I understand the question, but I'm going to pretend I don't let Charlie answer first. I really do. Yeah, when you're trying to determine something like intrinsic value and margin of safety and so on, there is no one easy method that could be simply mechanically applied by say a computer and make anybody who could punch the buttons rich. By definition, this is going to be a game which you play with multiple techniques and multiple models, and a lot of experience is very helpful. I don't think you can become a great investor very rapidly anymore than you could become a great bone tumor pathologist very rapidly. It takes some experience and that's why it's helpful to get a very early start. Let's just say that we all decided we're going to buy a or think about buying a farm. We go up 30 miles north of here and we find out that a farm up there can produce 120 bushels of corn and it can produce 45 bushels of soybean per acre. We know what fertilizer costs and we know what the property taxes cost and we know what we'll have to pay the farmer to actually do the work involved and we'll get some number that we can make per acre using fairly conservative assumptions and it's used. Let's just assume that when you get through making those calculations, it turns out to be that you can make $70 an acre to the owner without working at it. Then the question is how much do you pay for the $70? Do you assume that agriculture will get a little bit better over the years so that your yields will be a little higher? Do you assume that prices will work a little higher over time? They haven't done much of that although recently it's been good with corn and soybeans but over the years agriculture prices have not done too much so you would be conservative of your subject and you might decide that for $70 an acre, you know you would want to if you decided you wanted a 7% return, you'd pay $1,000 an acre. Now if farmland is selling for 900, you know you're going to have a buy signal and if it's selling for 1200, you're going to look at something else. That's what we do in businesses. We are trying to figure out what those corporate farms that we're looking at are going to produce and to do that we have to understand their competitive position. We have to understand the dynamics of the business. We have to be able to look out in the future and like I've said earlier some businesses that can't look out very far in but the mathematics of investment were set out by ESOP 600 BC and he said a burden the hand is worth two in the bush. Now our question is when do we get the two? How long do we wait? How sure are we that there are two in the bush? Could there be more? What's the right discount rate? And we measure one against the other that way. I mean we are looking at all bunch of businesses. How many birds are they going to give us? One are they going to give them to us and we try to decide which ones, you know basically which which which bushes we want to buy out in the future. It's all about and it's all about evaluating future future ability to distribute cash or to reinvest cash and high rates if it isn't distributed. Berser is never distributed any cash but it's growing in its cash producing abilities and we retain it because we think we can create more than a dollar present value by retaining it but it's the ability to distribute cash that give Berser its value and we try to increase that ability to distribute cash year by year by year and then we try to keep it and invest it in a way so that's a dollar bill is worth more than a dollar. You may have an insight into very few businesses. I mean if we left here and walked by a McDonald's stand you know and you decided would you pay a million dollars for that McDonald's stand or a million three or 900 thousand you'd think about how likely it was there would be more competition how whether McDonald's could change the franchise arrangement on you whether people are going to keep eating hamburgers you know all kinds of things and you actually would say to yourself this McDonald's stand will make x x plus 5% maybe in a couple years because over time prices will increase a little and that's that's all investing is but the you have to know when you know what you're doing and you have to know when you're getting outside of what I call your circle of competence and you don't have the fainless idea. Charlie. Yeah the other thing you had to recognize that we've never had any system for being able to make correct judgments on the values of all businesses. We throw almost all decisions into the two hard pile and we just sift for a few decisions we can make that are easy and that's a comparative process and and if you're if you're looking for an ability to correctly value of all investments at all times we can't help you. We know how to step over one foot bars we don't know how to jump over seven foot bars but we do know how to recognize occasionally what is a one foot bar and and we know not to stay away from the seven foot bars too."
how youngster like myself would develop and define their circle of competence.,"Oh, yeah, that's a good question. I would say this, if you have doubts about something being injured, your circle of competence, it isn't. I know, in other words, I would look down the list of businesses and I will bet you that you can understand a Coke bottle or a Coke or a Coke company. You can understand McDonald's. You can understand in a general way, General Motors, you may not be able to value it, but there are all kinds of business. You can certainly understand Walmart, that doesn't mean whether you decide what the price should be, but you understand Walmart. You can understand Costco, and if you get to something that your friend is buying or everybody says a lot of money is going to be made in, and you're not sure whether you understand it or not, you don't. It's better to be well within the circle than to be trying to tip toe along the line. You'll find plenty of things within the circle. It's not terrible to have a small circle of competence. I'd say my circle of competence is pretty small, but it's big enough. I can find a few things. When somebody calls me with a Larsen Jewel, that is within my circle of competence. I hadn't even thought about it before, but I know it's within it. I can evaluate a business like that. If I get called the other day, a very large finance company, I understand what they do, but I don't understand everything is going on within it. I don't understand whether I can continually fund it on a basis independent from using purchase credit and so on. Even though I could understand every individual transaction they did, I don't regard the whole enterprise or the operation of it necessarily is being within my circle of competence. Charlie, I think if you have competence, you almost automatically have a feeling of where the edge of the competence is. After all, it wouldn't be much of a competence if you didn't know it's boundary. I think you've asked a question that almost answers itself. My guess is you do know what your permanent competence is. All kinds of areas. You do have all kinds of other areas where you know you'd be over your depth. You're not trying to play chess against Bobby Fisher or Buston's on the high trapeze if you've had no training for it. My guess is you know pretty well where the boundaries of your competence lies. I think you also probably know pretty well where you want to stretch the boundary. You've got to stretch the boundary by working at a, including practice. When the drawbacks to Berkshire of course is the Charlie and I, our circle is largely overlapped so you don't get too big and play circles at all but that's just the way it is. Probably why we get along so well too."
"I own another stock which sells for four times current trailing earnings. Every quarter we get a report. Earnings go up, sales go up, cash flow goes up, the equity-basics bans, the gain market share, and the stock goes down. The company has a 60% five-year annualized growth rate and sells it four times earnings. I have two related questions. First, is this a growth stock or a value stock? And could you please give us your definitions of these terms? Second, the company sells recreational vehicles. Demographic trends in the recreation and leisure areas, RVs, cruise lines, golf equipment, etc. seem to be quite good. You see any opportunities for Berkshire here.","Well, the question about growth and value is that we've addressed in past annual reports, but they are not two distinct categories of business. Every business is worth the present. If you knew what it was going to be able to discourage and cash between now and judgment day, you could come to a precise figure as to what it is worth today. Now, elements of that can be the ability to use additional capital at good rates and most growth companies that characterize this growth companies have that as a characteristic. But there is no distinction in our minds between growth and value. Every business we look at as being a value proposition, the potential for growth and the likelihood of good economics being attached to that growth are part of the equation in evaluation. But they're all value decisions. A company that pays no dividends, growing 100% of your losing money now, that's a value decision. You have to decide how much value you're going to get. Actually, it's very simple. The first investment primer, one would you guess it was written? The first investment primer that I know of, and it was pretty good advice, was delivered in about 600 BC by Esop. And Esop, you'll remember, said, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I incidentally, Esop did not know it was 600 BC. He was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Now, Esop was on to something, but he didn't finish it. Because there's a couple of other questions that go along with that. But it is an investment equation. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He forgot to say exactly when you were going to get the two in the bush. And he forgot to say what interest rates were that you had to measure this against. But if he'd given those two factors, he would have defined investment for the next 2600 years. Because a bird in the hand is, you know, you will trade a bird in the hand, which is investing you lay out cash today. And then the question is, as an investment decision, you have to evaluate how many birds are in the bush. You may think there are two birds in the bush, if Ray birds in the bush, and you have to decide when they're going to come out, and when you're going to acquire them. Now, if interest rates are 5%, and you're going to get two birds from the bush in five years, we'll say versus one now, two birds in the bush are much better than a bird in the hand now. So you want to trade your bird in the hand and say, I'll take two birds in the bush because if you're going to get them in five years, that's roughly 14% compounded annually and interest rates are only 5%. But if interest rates were 20%, you would decline to take two birds in the bush five years from now. You would say that's not good enough because at 20%, if I just keep this bird in my hand and compounded, I'll have more birds than two birds in the bush in five years. Now, what's all that got to do with growth? Well, usually growth people associate with a lot more birds in the bush, but you still have to decide when you're going to get them. And you have to measure that against interest rates, and you have to measure it against other bushes and other equations. And that's all investing in. It's a value decision based on, you know, what it is worth, how many birds are in that bush, when you're going to get them and what interest rates are. Now, if you pay 500 billion dollars, and when we buy a stock, we always think in terms of buying the whole enterprise because it enables us to think as businessmen rather than as stock speculators. So let's just take a company that has marvelous prospects is paying you nothing now, and you buy at a valuation of 500 billion. Now, if you feel that 10% is the appropriate rate of return, and you can pick your figure, that means that if it pays you nothing this year, but starts paying next year, it has to be able to pay you 55 billion in perpetuity each year. But if it's not going to pay until the third year, then it has to pay you 60.5 billion in perpetuity, in perpetuity to justify the present price. Every year that you wait to take a bird out of the bush, means that you have to take out more birds. It's that simple. And I question in my mind whether sometimes, whether people who pay 500 billion dollars implicitly for a business by buying 10 shares of stock at some price, I really thinking of the mathematical, the mathematics implicit in what they are doing. To deliver, let's just assume that there's only going to be a one year delay before the business starts paying out to you, and you want to get a 10% return in you pay 500 billion. That means 55 billion of cash. So they have to be able to be able to discourage to you a year after a year after year. To do that, they have to make perhaps 80 billion dollars or close to a pre-tax. Now you might look around at the University of businesses in this world and see how many are earning 80 billion pre-tax, or 70 or 60 or 50 or 40 or 30, and you won't find any. So it requires a rather extraordinary change in profitability to give you enough birds out of that particular bush to make it worthwhile to give up the one that you have in your hand. The second part of your question about whether we'd be willing to buy a wonderful business at four times, I think I could get even Charlie interested in that. But let's hear it from Charlie. I'd like to know what that is. He was hoping you would ask that fellow that's got all his net worth in his stock. And who has a captive audience. Tell us what it is. You got to tell us we're begging you. You want the name of the company? We want the name of the company we're dying to get the name. Wait till I get my pencil out. It's called National RV and it's based in California and they sell recreational vehicles. Okay, well you've got to crowd up people with who have birds in the hand and we will see what they do in terms of National RV. Charlie, do you have anything further on growth and value, etc? I'm watching carefully folks. Well, I agree that all intelligent investing is value investing. You have to acquire more than you really pay for and that's a value judgment. But you can look for more than you're paying for in a lot of different ways. You can use filters to sift the investment universe. And if you stick with stocks that can't possibly be wonderful to just put away in your safe deposit box for 40 years but are underpriced, then you have to keep moving around all the time as they get closer to what you think the real value is. You have to sell them and then find others. So it's an active kind of investing. The investing where you find a few great companies and just sit on your ass because you've correctly predicted the future. That is what it's very nice to be good at. The movie was g-rated even though."
"I have a question, it's not really related to intrinsic value or any of that stuff, but more on houses. I'm still quite young, I don't have a house yet and I'm thinking about buying a house someday soon and in order to do that I'm going to have to put a down payment which means I might have to share or sell my shares and I was wondering if you can provide some insight on when is the best time to buy a house and how much down payment you should be putting down in relation to interest rates and also in relation to available cash and the stock market.","Well Charlie's going to give you an answer to that in a second, I'll just relate one story which was when I got married we did have about $10,000 starting off and I closed the Susie, I said now you know there's two choices, it's up to you, you can either buy a house which will use up all my capital, clean me out and it'll be like a carpenter who's had his tools taken away from him or or what you can might be work on this and someday who knows maybe I'll even buy a little bit larger house that would otherwise be the case so she was very understanding on that point and we waited until 1956 that we got married in 1952 and I decided to buy a house when the down payment was about 10% or so of my network because I really felt I wanted to use the capital for other purposes but that was a way different environment in terms of what was available to buy. If you have the house you want to buy I definitely believe in just going out and probably getting the job done but in effect you're probably making something in the area of the 7 or 8% investment implicitly when you do it so you'll have to figure out your own equation from that, Charlie probably has better advice on that, he's a big homeowner. It both senses of the word. I think the time to buy a house is when you need one and when do you need one? Well I have very old fashioned ideas on that too, the single people I don't care if they ever get a house. When do you need one of your marriage Charlie? I'll follow up there for you. You need one when your wife wants one. I think you've got that exactly right. Gregory Crawford needs to go to the security office please for emergency message Gregory Crawford to the security officer office for emergency message thank you. Okay, hope it isn't a margin call."
Could you please explain what you believe the impact and hopefully benefit of a credit contraction would be on Bercher-Hathaway and maybe higher interest rates as well?,"Well, we do benefit one other suffer. That doesn't mean we enjoy their suffering, but times of chaos in financial markets, the situation that existed in junk bonds in 2002, the situation that existed in equities back in 1974. So I don't think you'll necessarily see a contraction and credit. That I think most authorities are very reluctant to really step on the brakes. It's too easy to figure out who did step on the brakes. But you could very well see some exogenous event. It starts feeding on itself in markets. In fact, I think it's much more prone to feed on itself in markets than in most periods in the past. If you really got a shock to the system. And that would result in a huge widening of credit spreads, cheaper equity prices, all kinds of things that actually are helpful to Bercher, because we usually have at least some money around to do something at times like that. There will be periods like that. If you go back 30 or 40 years, when credit contracted, it just really wasn't available. Charlie and I went through a couple of periods like that. We were trying to buy a bank in Chicago 40 years ago. And the only people that would lend to us in the world, because banks weren't lending for acquisitions. We found some people over in Kuwait who said they'd lend it to us in denars. And we thought it might be fine to borrow of that when it came time to pay them back the denars. They would probably be telling us what the denar was worth. So we passed on that particular deal. I mean, you had real credit contractions then. And of course, the whole reason, I would say, the major reason the Federal Reserve was established was the huge contractions in credit that were felt, particularly here in places like the Midwest, where they were dependent on correspondent banks in the larger cities. And when those banks had problems, these banks here got shot off. And we really needed a system that would not have that happen except by design. And I would say the Fed by design is probably not going to produce any credit crunches, Charlie. Well, last time we had that credit contraction, we made one a quick three or four billion dollars. And we were acting was bigger. The whole investment world is more and more competitive. And if you talk about a real credit contraction, which gums up the whole civilization, no one would welcome that. And I would predict that if we ever had a really big credit contraction after a period like the one we're in with all this excess, which is causing so much envy and resentment, that we would get legislation that most of us wouldn't like. There's a book by Jonathan Alver that came out about a year ago that talks about the first 100 days after Roosevelt took over. And by the nature of the book it tells about some of the days before that, too. But if you want to get an example of, I mean, this country was close to the brink at that point. And basically Roosevelt got anything he passed he wanted, just as fast as they could write the bills initially. And that was a good thing, with banks closing and people dealing in script and that sort of thing. So nobody wants that to come back. And we've learned a lot more about that sort of thing. Since the Great Depression, I don't think you'll see an orchestrated credit contraction. Now you had in 1998, in the fall, when long-term capital management got trouble, you had a seize up of the credit markets. It wasn't an orchestrated by the Fed type contraction. You simply had people panic about even the most, even the safest of instruments and credit spreads doing things that they'd never done before. And that's a rather interesting example, because that was not 100 years ago. It was less than 10 years ago. We had all kinds of people with a high IQs in Wall Street. We had all kinds of people with cash available. And you had some really extraordinary things happen in credit markets, simply because people panic. And they fell. A lot of people were going to panic. And you get these second and third degree type reactions in markets. We will see that sort of thing again. It won't be the same. But as Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. And we will have something that rhymes with 1998."
"am very interested in your policies on diversification and also how you concentrate your investments. And I've studied your annual reports going back a good number of years. And there's been years where you had a lot of stocks in your marketable, equitable securities, portfolio. And there was one year where you only had three in 1987. So I have two questions. Given the number of stocks that you have in the portfolio now, what does that imply about your view of the market in terms of, is it fairly valued? That kind of idea. And second of all, whenever you, it seems that whenever you take a new investment, you never take less than about 5% and never more than about 10% of the total portfolio. If that new position, and I wanted to see if I'm correct about that.","Yeah, well, on the second point, that really isn't correct. We have positions which you don't even see because we only listed the ones above 600 million in the last report. And obviously, those are all smaller positions. Sometimes that's because they're smaller companies and we couldn't get that much money in. Sometimes it's because the price has moved up after we bought them. Sometimes it's because we may be selling the position down even. So there's nothing magic. We like to put a lot of money in things that we feel strongly about. And that gets back to the diversification question. We think diversification as practice generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing. The diversification is a protection against ignorance. I mean, if you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you own everything. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, that has a perfectly sound approach for somebody who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses. If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it's crazy don't 50 stocks or 40 stocks or 30 stocks probably because there aren't that many wonderful businesses that are understandable to a single human being and all likelihood and to have some super wonderful business and then put money in number 30 or 35 on your list of attractiveness and forgo putting more money in the number one, just strikes Charlie as madness. And it's conventional practice and it may, you know, if all you have to achieve is average. It's a, it's a may preserve your job, but it's a confession in our view that you don't really understand the businesses that you own. You know, I base on a personal portfolio basis, you know, I own one stock, you know, but it's a business I know. It's then, and it leaves me very comfortable. So, you know, do I need own 28 stocks? You know, I have proper diversification, you know, and be nonsense. And within Berkshire, I could pick out three of our businesses and I would, I would be very happy if they were the only businesses we own and I had all my money in Berkshire. Now I love it the fact that we can find more than that and that we keep adding to it. But three wonderful businesses is more than, it's more than you need in this life to do very well. And the average, the average person isn't going to run into that. I mean, if you look at how the fortunes were built in this country, they weren't built out of a portfolio of 50 companies. They were built by someone who identified with a wonderful business. Coca-Cola is a great example. A lot of fortunes have been built on that and there aren't 50 Coca-colas. There aren't 20. If there were, be fine. We could all go out and diversify like crazy among that group and get results that would be equal to owning the really wonderful one. But you're not going to find it and the truth is you don't need it. I mean, if you have a really wonderful business is very well protected against the vicissitudes of the economy over time and competition. I mean, we're talking about businesses that are resistant to effective competition and three of those will be better than 100 average businesses. And they'll be safer, incidentally. I mean, there is less risk in owning three easy to identify wonderful businesses than there is in owning 50 well-known big businesses. It's amazing what has been taught over the years in finance classes about that. But I can assure you that I would rather pick if I had to bet the next 30 years, on the fortunes of my family, it would be dependent upon the income from a given group of businesses. I would rather pick three businesses from those we all and then own a diversify group of 50. Charlie? Yeah, what he's saying is that much of what is taught in modern corporate finance courses is toadle. Do you want to elaborate on that, Charlie? You cannot believe this stuff. I mean, it's a modern portfolio theory. It has no utility. I mean, it will tell you how to do average. But I think anybody can figure out how to do average in fifth grade. I mean, it's just not that difficult. It's elaborate. And there's lots of little Greek letters and all kinds of things to make you feel that you're in the big leagues. But there is no value added. I have great difficulty with it because I am something of a student of dementia. But we hang around a lot today. And I get to learn early. Classified dementia. You know, on some theory structure of models, but the modern portfolio theory, it involves the type of dementia I just can't even classify. Something very strange is going on. If you find three wonderful businesses in your life, you'll get very rich. And if you understand them, bad things aren't going to happen to those three. I mean, that's the characteristic of it. By the way, maybe that's the reason there's so much dementia. If you believe that Warren said, you teach the whole course in about a week. Yeah, and the high priest wouldn't have any edge over the lay people. That never sells well. Right."
"I was kind of curious if you could tell me, do you know or can you tell us how much business Nebraska furniture mart and Borshams did this weekend? And secondly, do you have any interest in investing in the auto industry and if not interested now, what would change your mind about this industry in the future?","Well, the first question, I don't know what the market did, but I do know they had a lot of shareholders there, I've gotten an edge of the verbal report on that. There would be less change in their normal business. They do, you know, you're talking about a company that at the mart that does $800,000 a day on average, it is a big operation. So our shareholders have an impact, but not the relative impact that they would have at Borshams. Borshams did over twice as much this year as last year and that a big day. And what was the other question, Dr. Munger. The auto industry. Yeah, we surely Charlie was big in general motors in the mid-60s, right? Charlie and your biggest commitment and I had the temper. Luckily it passed. Yeah, I made money on it, Ted. Yeah, I did. We, it's kind of industry that's it's interesting for us to follow. I mean, it's it many years ago it was the dominant factor or overwhelming factor in the economy. It's diminished to the fair amount, but it's still a very important industry and it's the kind of industry that anyone can follow. I mean, you have experience with the product and competing products and everyone in this room understands in a general way the economy, the economic nature of the industry, but we've never felt that we understood it better than other people. So we've seen auto companies at very well, multiple sometimes and with prices that in hindsight look very attractive, but we've never really felt that we knew who among the auto companies five years from now would have gained the most brown relative to where they are now or the gain the most brown relative to what the market might expect. It just isn't given to us that knowledge."
"I'd like you to address how you conceive of the portfolio of businesses in the context of these possible transformative events, especially given that over this same time period of maybe the next 50 years, at some point you're not going to be able to personally revise the portfolio.","Yeah, I think it's a fair statement that over the next 50 years at some point, Charlie, and I will not personally be able to participate in portfolio revisions. We are quite correct that people tend to underestimate low probability events when they haven't happened recently and overestimate them when they have happened recently. That's the nature of the human animal. You know, Noah ran into that some years back. Well, they look pretty good after 40 days. What you mentioned on the nuclear question, it's a matter of you can do the math easily, what you don't know is what you're using the right assumptions. But for example, if there is a 10% chance in any given year of a major nuclear event, the chance that you'll get through 50 years without it happening if the 10% is correct is a half a 1%. I mean, 99.5% of the time, a 10% event per year will catch up with you. In 50 years, if you can reduce that, the 1%, there's a 60% chance you'll get through the next 50 years without it happening. That's a good argument for trying to reduce the chances of it happening. In terms of our businesses, I think Charlie and I are, I mean, we think about low probability events. In fact, in insurance, we probably think about low probability events more than most people who have been insurance executives throughout their year. It's just our nature to think about that sort of thing. But I would say if you talk about transforming events or really talk about major events that can have huge consequences that are low probability, they're more likely to be in the financial arena than in the natural phenomena arena. But we'll think about them in both cases. But we do spend a lot of time thinking about things that can go wrong in a very big and very unexpected way. And financial markets are, they have vulnerabilities to that that we try to think of. And we try to build in ways that protect us against it and perhaps even build in some capabilities that where we think we might profit a huge way from it. Charlie. Yeah, that temporary collapse and the junk bonds where they got down many of them to 35 and 40% yields. That's a strange thing. And they have all those things popped back, you know, quadrupling in a short time. There was absolute chaos at the bottom of that. And that isn't as much chaos as you could have. And of course, it can happen in common stocks instead of junk bonds. So I think if you're talking about the next 50 years, we all have to conduct ourselves so that we won't be all that awful or real financial crunch of some kind that could come along either in flationary or a typical deflationary crunch at the time that people used to have the great many decades ago. Probably the most dramatic way in which we give evidence of our of your work. And we just don't believe in a lot of leverage. I mean, you could have thought junk bonds were wonderful at 15% because they eventually did go to 6%. You would have made a lot of money. But if you owed a lot of money against them in between, you wouldn't have been around for the party at the end. So we believe almost anything can happen in financial markets. And the only way smart people can get clobbered really is through leverage. If you can hold them, you have no real problems. So we have a great aversion to leverage. And we would predict a very high percentage of the smart people operating in Wall Street at one time or another are likely to get clobbered through the use of leverage. It's the one thing that forces you or it's one thing that ends or can prevent you from playing out your hand. And all of the hands we enter into look pretty good to us. But you do have to be able to play them out. And the fascinating to me is that just take the junk bond situation. In 2002, he had people with a terrific IQ, tens of thousands of them operating in Wall Street. You had the money was available. They all had a desire to make money. And then you see these extraordinary things happen in markets and you say to yourself, can these be the same individuals a two years later or two years earlier? We're buying these things at prices that were double or triple or quadruple what they sunk to win between. And did they all go on vacation? Did they lose their ability to raise money? Now the money was, Wall Street was a washing money. And it was a washing talent. And you get these absolutely extraordinary swings. I mean, it doesn't happen with apartment houses in Omaha or McDonald's franchises or farms or something. But it's just astounding what can happen in the marketable securities department. And the big thing you want to do is, at a minimum, you want to protect yourself against that sort of insanity wiping you out. And better yet, you want to be prepared to take advantage of it when it happens."
"Years ago you listed the four or five investment vehicles you considered appropriate for a Berkshire including I believe, Common Stocks, Long Term Dead and Arbitraged opportunities. In light of your comments in this year's annual report, I was wondering if you could do that list in order of preference and specifically comment on them including the current environment for Arbitraged.","Well, the items you name and you could break that down by high grade bonds versus young bonds and the items you mentioned are all alternatives. Charlie and I sit around and think about what's the best thing to do with Arbitraged. It's a fairly simple proposition and we have a number of things that we feel competent to make judgments on and we have a number of things that we're not competent to make judgments on. So we narrowed, we hope the narrow the field to investments that we think we can understand and there are reasonable number of those although there are a lot that we can't understand. Anything I would say today can change tomorrow. We don't think about the categories by themselves. Now in a period like summer to mid fall of 2002 when junk bonds became very attractive, we bought a lot of them. We didn't make some great decision to buy junk bonds. We just started seeing things, individual items that started screaming at us, you know, buy, buy, buy. And then that came to an end. And so we don't go to the office in the morning thinking what category, how do we prioritize our categories. We have an open mind and whatever we see that day that overcomes or that crosses the threshold of where we take money out of short-term cash and move into it. It could be Arbitraged. It's unlikely to be Arbitraged now because that's a game that to play on a scale that would have a meaningful effect that Berkshire is hard to do. I mean, take very big deals and it's something we've done successfully in the past. We've made a lot of money over the years in Arbitraged and quite consistently sometimes in the past. But we don't, Charlie and I do not have a checklist that we talk about every day or every month or every year in terms of prioritizing categories. We just hope I hope he gets a good idea. He hopes I get a good idea. And when we get one, we move in a big way. They have to be big now and that's a limiting factor in terms of what's available for us. As you know, if you read the annual report, we took a significant position in currencies. We're buying pionicle settlements in terms of the transaction I mentioned a little earlier. We're open to anything we can understand, Charlie. Yeah, you really asked us to determine an order of presidency among two or three activities. We don't have much interest in at the moment. And that's not something we spend a lot of time at. In other words, we have all this cash because we don't much like any of those fields at the moment. And spending all the time thinking about orders of presidency among things you clearly are not going to do is pretty fruitless for us. Yeah, I thought I had a slide here, but I don't, but it, when we were buying junk bonds in the, in the summer fall of 2002, we were literally buying securities and we limited it to the kind of junk bonds we can understand, which is far from the whole universe. But we were, we were literally buying things on a 30, 35, 40% yield to maturity basis. Now, we buy those with a mental attitude of buying common stocks. Interestingly enough, within 12 months, some of those same securities that were yielding 30 or 35% went to prices where they yielded only 6%. I mean, that is truly remarkable when you think about that happening in a country that was not in the throes of depression or anything. I mean, prices do amazing things in securities markets. And when they do something that strikes us as amazing in our direction, you know, we will act. But we do not know today what we're going to be doing tomorrow. We have, we, you know, we have some things, few things we might maybe doing. They're likely, it's likely we're doing them tomorrow. But there's, you know, the whole any committee meetings on this and there's, you know, this business where somebody says you should have 50% of your money and bonds and 35% and, you know, inequities and 15. We don't go through anything like that. I mean, we regard that as nonsense."
"In this era, when the financial departments of the institutions of higher learning are referring to you as an anomaly, and they preach the efficient market stock offices stating that you can't outperform the market, where does one go to find a mentor like you found in Ben Graham?","Someone you can ask questions to regarding value investing. My understanding is that the University of Florida has instituted a couple of courses that actually Mason Hawkins gave him a significant amount of money to finance, and I believe they're teaching something other than efficient markets there. There's a very good course at Columbia, I know that gets a lot of visiting teachers to come in. I go in there and teach occasionally, but a number of practitioners do. I think the efficient market theory is less holy-writ now than it was 15 or 20 years ago in universities, but there's a lot of it taught, but I think you can find more diversity in what is being offered now than 10 or 20 years ago. I'd recommend looking into those two schools. It's really quite useful. If you had a merchant shipping business, all of your competitors believe the world is flat. It is a huge edge because they will not take any cargo to go to places that are beyond where they think they will fall off. We should be encouraging the teaching of efficient market theories in universities. It amazes me. I think one time that Keynes said that most economists are most economical about ideas that they make the ones they learned in graduate school last a lifetime. What happens is that you spend years getting your PhD in finance and you learn theories with a lot of mathematics and that the average layman can't do and you become a high priest and you get an enormous amount of yourself, an ego, and even professional security invested in those ideas. It gets very hard to back off after a given point. I think that some extent is contaminated. The teaching of investing in the university is trolling. I would argue that the contamination was massive. But it's waning. It is waning. It's waning. It's a good idea to eventually try out. The word anomaly I've always found interesting on that. After a while, I mean, Columbus was an anonymous. What it means is something that the academicians could not explain and rather than re-examine their theories, they simply discarded any evidence of that sort as anomalous. I think when you find information that contradicts previously cherished beliefs, you've got a special obligation to look at it and look at it quickly. I think Charlie told me that one of the things Darwin did was that whenever he found anything that contradicts some previous belief, he knew that he had to write it down almost immediately because he felt that the human mind was conditioned, so conditioned to reject contradictory evidence that unless he got it down in black and white very quickly, his mind would simply push it out of existence. Charlie knows more about Darwin than I do. Maybe he can explain that. Well, I don't know about Darwin, but I did find it amusing. One of these extreme, efficient-market theorists explained Warren for many, many years as an anomaly of luck. He got the six segments, six standard deviations of luck. And then people started laughing at him because six segments of luck is a lot. So he changed his theory. Now Warren has six or seven segments of skill. So you see, I'd rather have the six segments of luck actually. The one thing he couldn't bear to leave was his six segments."
"For you, Mr. Buffett, you obviously have filters that you apply on selecting people as you do on stocks. Can you tell us a little bit about what those filters are?","Filters on people. Yes, in selecting. You have an ability to motivate people who have a lot of money to keep working."
What do you look for to figure out who those people are?,"That is a key question, because when we buy businesses, we don't have managers to put in them. We are not buying them that way. We don't have a lot of MBAs around the office that we're... Thank God. Yeah. I have not promised that they're going to have all kinds of opportunities. So as a practical matter, we need management with the businesses that we buy. And three times out of four, they're about... The manager is the owner and is receiving tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars. They don't have to work. And we have to decide in that time when we meet them whether they love the business or love money. And we're not making a moral judgment, Charlie May, but I'm not making a moral judgment about whether it's better to love the business or love money. But it's very important for me to know which of the two is the primary motivator with them. So we have had extremely good luck in identifying people who love their business. And so all we have to do is avoid anything that... On our part, that diminishes that love of the business or makes other conditions so intolerable that they overcome that love of the business. And we have a number of people working for us that have no financial need to work at all. And they probably outwork 95% or more of the people in the world. And they do it because they love smacking them all. And we've virtually had no mistakes in that respect. And we have identified a number of people, Charlie and I have in terms of proposals to us where we felt that they did really... They liked the money better than the business. They were kind of tired of the business. And they might promise us that they would continue on and they would do it in good faith. But something would happen six months later, a year later. And they'd say to themselves, why am I doing this? For Berkshire Hathaway, what I got when I could be doing whatever else they want to do. I can't tell you exactly what Phil or it is that we put them through mentally. But I can tell you that if you've been around a while, I think you can have a pretty high batting average in coming to those conclusions. As you can about other aspects of human behavior, I'm not saying you can take 100 people and take a look at them and analyze their personalities or anything of the sort. But I think when you see the extreme cases, the ones that are kind of causing nothing but trouble or the ones that are going to bring in nothing but joy, I think you've been identified those pretty well. Charlie. Well, yeah, I think it's pretty simple. You've got integrity, intelligence and experience and dedication. That's what human enterprises need to run well. We've been very lucky in getting this marvelous group of associates to work with all these years. It would be hard to do better, I think, than we've done on that respect. Book around this place. I mean, and for the young people look around this place. Look at how much gratification can come into these lives which have been mostly spent in diverting gratification. It's a very funny group of people, you share holders."
"You've taught us that a key concept of Berkshire is the amount of float it has, the cost of the float and how fast it grows. Can you please help us understand currently what amount of float Berkshire has and what the goals are in the future for that growth rate over a sort of one to two decade period, understanding that it will be a lumpy advance.","Looking at the historical data you provided us for January and Berkshire regarding the amount of float in its cost, it's grown in a great rate in high teens, low 20s. And if you could please comment on the future expectations we should have, that would be great. Well it's an important question, but I don't know how to give you a good answer. It's grown at a much faster rate since 1967 when we went into insurance business than I thought it would. I didn't anticipate it would grow that way. I didn't anticipate necessarily we'd get a chance to buy a guy, go. I didn't necessarily know we'd never acquire a general rear. So it's been very hard to forecast what we've tried to do is grow cheap float as fast as we could. Sometimes it's been easy, sometimes it's been impossible. But I don't know if you'd asked me that question 30 years ago, I'd have given you an answer that really hasn't proven out very well. So I don't know how to give you the answer now except to tell you this, it's very much a goal of Berkshire to grow that float at as fast as it can while maintaining a very low cost to it. And again, you mentioned it'd be lumpy. Well, it'll be lumpy on cost. It'll be lumpy on growth rate. But I mean, we're, it's something we think about all of the time in both our operating decisions and perhaps some big capital commitment decision. We know that if we can solve that problem of how to grow it with it costing us relatively little, that we will make Berkshire a whole lot more valuable in the process. And people, I mean, we always laid out the facts as to what we were doing, but people basically seemed to ignore that. And we have had this growth rate which we can't maintain. The numbers are too big. But it's something that Charlie and I think about all the time. We've got some good vehicles for growing it. We don't have any vehicles that will grow it in aggregate or anything like the rate that's been growing in the past. So we may have to, we may get a chance to do something that adds to our ability to do it. If we get a chance and it's at the right price, we'll add it. If we won't, we'll do as much as we can internally. But the question you ask, growth and intrinsic value of Berkshire over the next year, ten years will be determined in a very significant way by, by the rate at which we do grow it. And also the added fact of what it causes to achieve that flow. Charlie? Yeah, if we grow very low cost float at the same rate that it's grown in the past for another thirty years, we can be confident of one thing. If you look to the heavens, there'll be a star in the east. This one has been introverted really quite a 360 degree pollution from what you've heard. Exactly. They call it quería también que tenga un fascinán."
"I have been a shareholder for six years at Berkshire, Halfway. My questions are, what are Geico's sustainable competitive advantages? And my other one is, what are the implications of the internet on pricing for the auto insurance industry?","The sustainable competitive advantage that Geico is to be the low cost producer providing very good service. And there will be a number of companies that provide good service. So that that does not distinguish us from a great many competitors. Having the low cost is crucial. There are companies that specialize in given groups of share of policyholders, but smaller groups, such as USAAA that have very good costs. So they are very, very competitive with us in their chosen area. There's another company in Los Angeles that geographically calls 21st century insurance that has costs like ours. And so they are extremely competitive within that geographic area. I don't think anybody is any better than us who operates nationwide. We don't operate in Massachusetts or New Jersey, but in the other 40 state states, we will have a quote for about anyone. So in terms of a broad-based insurance, auto insurance competitor, our competitive advantage has to be low cost over time. Now we also have to be as good at distinguishing among the risks posed by different kinds of drivers as other people. In other words, we have to be able to select people who are going to be better than average drivers and we have to be able to understand who was likely to be a poor that average driver. But and the ability to do that to distinguish those people would be a competitive advantage. I think that many companies tend to be fairly equal on that point. So it's really at this cost level and we care very much about costs the same way that Charlie mentioned the company called Costco does in terms of retailing. They they figure their expense ratios out to 100% and that is important. So that is that is the competitive advantage. Now when you get and we have to sustain and widen that if possible. The question of the internet, it's going to be very important that already is important to Geico. It will be more and more important. It will be important to the insurance industry. Because when you have the internet, you have a situation where somebody thinking about ensuring a car can click to one place, find out what that rate will be. They can click to someplace else and find out what that rate will be. So in effect, they can shop all around without going from place to place to place and driving all over town or calling lots of agents. They can just do it right there and they're in their in their den. And that makes it very important again that we be the low-cost company. It I think it's going to be an advantage for us over time. For one thing, I think it makes brand very important because we want people to be thinking of Geico as one of the possibilities to call. And if you've got the XYZ company that nobody's ever heard of, nobody's going to think about clicking on them. And Geico's brand is becoming extremely familiar to people throughout the country and we're spending a lot of money to make it even more familiar. So you've asked two very good questions and I think we're in pretty good shape on both of them."
"My question is concerning that what you were just describing as smelling. And I mean you told us in former shareholder meetings, if management loves money, do not invest. If they love what they do, preferably if they come tap dancing to the office every day, and all other things are right then invest. That resonated to me very good with the biblical truths that not money itself but love for money is the root of all evil. And the principle that once made pressure the largest of all German kingdoms, namely the ethos of doing a job for its own sake. When you tell us in this years report that you buy a company after talking to the owners for no more than 90 minutes, I'm wondering what kind of is it the wisdom of experience just like it described it. Or do you do more background work before talking to the owners for 90 minutes? What's the process like? Do you do background checks? Do you talk to competitors? Do the other people in headquarters do that work for you? How does this whole thing work?","Well, it's a very good question. And all of the things you suggest might well make sense. I mean talking to competitors, talking to ex employees, talking to current employees, talking to customers, talking to suppliers. All of those things still officially laid out in a book over 40 years ago. And we have done a fair amount of that over the years. But Charlie would have behaved exactly the same way I did on the company you're referring to. I got a call from Craig Ponceo in December on a Monday. It was about a company that made custom picture frames. I'd never heard of the company before. I'd never heard of Craig before. I didn't talk to him on the phone much more than 15 minutes. He's a very severe today. His wife became seriously ill or at least we hope we hope it's not serious, but at least there was a problem last night. But Craig talked to me maybe 20 minutes. And you can tell when I mean it's just all the difference in the world. And he laid out what the custom frame, how other custom frame picture business works. And it's not complicated. I hadn't thought about it for 10 seconds in my whole life up till that. You know, I've had some pictures framed. I get around. It's not hard. I mean, if you think about it for 30 seconds, the economics of the industry will sort of make themselves manifest to you. They're 18,000 or so. Framers in the country. It's a small business. So you're dealing with thousands of people. Now what's important to those thousands of people that you're dealing to? They're doing 250,000 or 300 or 400,000 dollars of business here. And they have customers who come in periodic like I have my come in once every three months or every six months and say here, I'd like a frame and they may ask me about what kind of frame I want or I may leave it up to them. It's a service or operation to a very great degree. And Craig built something starting with in 1980 or so with three million of sales. He built an organization that became enormously responsive to these 18,000 or so. They call on those people five or six times a year. They get 85% of the frames of those people the next day when they order them. That's what counts in that kind of a business. You know, it's not an, you're not supplying the big free with auto parts. You're not there's all kinds of things that give it a distinctive economic character. Craig told me about that. Like I say, and not more than 20 minutes. He told me the price and he told me the capital was employed. He gave me some a few figures. I knew in talking to him that they had a deal that made sense. You know, and I said, what can you come in that was on a Monday said, I'll be there. One steam morning and and he came with Steve McKenzie who is here today and who I encourage you to meet and I think they got there at nine and they left at 10 30 and we check in hands. I was hoping to see Craig today or tomorrow, but I won't because of this illness, but I haven't seen Craig since. You know, I mean, we made that he got this money. He knew he was making a deal. He had a reason why he wanted. He wanted to sell up to somebody that would be sure to close that would be a good owner where the people who work there wouldn't be worried because he was leaving. He was leaving with a lot of money and you know, people he wanted to be sure a lot of people leave with a lot of money and they leave the employees behind it. They don't care what happens, but, but this guy carried and I can tell that and that that's a big plus with me. So, you know, I have not been to their headquarters yet. I plan to be to their headquarters. See by apologize. But I understand what the business is about and you can most most good businesses. You can understand what they are about in a very few minutes unless they're kind of business that you can never can understand what they're about. I mean, there are other businesses. If you spent years on them, you still wouldn't understand what the hell is going on. I don't know which one of which American auto company is going to do the best 10 years from now. And if I spent all year talking to dealers for Ford and Chrysler and General Motors and I talked to suppliers and I talked to people who are driving their cars, I still wouldn't know anything about what it's going to look like 5 or 10 years from now. But I know that you can't crack our custom picture frame business. I mean, you cannot figure out a way to call on those 18,000 people that are in that business and figure out a way to divert their business to you when you can't offer a frame as good as ours. And you can't offer service remotely like ours. So it's a good business and then the and Craig was 100% up. I mean, he told me exactly what they wanted to receive for the business. He wanted cash. You know, that fits us. And there's nothing complicated about it. I mean, you can drag it out for a long time. But what would be the sense of it? I mean, it's just going to make it deal. You're going to make it deal. Try. Yeah. If you stop to think about it, the ordinary result when a big publicly held corporation buys another corporation is that maybe 2 thirds of the time it's a terrible deal for the buying corporation. And yet the people have taken enormous time doing it. And we've bought all these businesses taking practically no time in doing it. And average, they've worked out wonderfully. Why is that? That's a good question. The answer is we wait for the no brainers. We're not trying to do the difficult things. And we have the patience to to wait. And then we're so peculiar that that they're actually are a good number of businesses in America where they prefer selling to us and the other people. That's very helpful. I just saw a review of a major company. May 10 acquisitions in us. Recent five year period. Every one of those 10 acquisitions was preceded by due diligence and all the ball only they go through and they probably had investment bankers book and everything. Now, one of the 10 in 2001 lived up or was even close to the expectation of the presentation that was made at the time of purchase. And aggregate the 10 earned. One quarter of what they were projected earn in 2001. In other words, the projections were for four times the actual earnings. And these were companies was strategic. This is a company with a strategic. You know, acquisition department with loads of people to go with the due diligence within that investment bankers, quote, helping them and quote all along the way. And 10 out of 10 failed miserably. And you know, you have to ask yourself, how can you produce that because the world didn't go to hell during that period either. I mean, it was that was not a time when we wanted to a great compression or anything of the sort. It's they they were getting. They were buying what was getting sold to them. And it was fulfilling some things that the management missed that the management had about itself and managements have many myths about themselves. And it isn't that complicated if you just right wait for the fat pitch. And the fat pitch doesn't have to be somebody else doing something dumber and anything like that because they people don't do that. And then people come to us come for a good reason. I mean, they they they they usually want to transaction. They want one they're sure to close they want if if it deal is made and they want one that will leave the people happy that are at the business when it was announced at John's band, I believe that the virtue was the buyer. And then I've seen it at you know, whether it's Jordan's or star furniture. People are concerned if you've been working to come up for 20 years and you know that the owning family is getting older and has some problems that take care of. Believe me, they talk in the hallways about that what's going to happen when you know the family sells the place and people worry about that and they have an answer for them. And then the night that they get its announced that the businesses change chances mean some to some a lot to some owners and it doesn't mean anything to any other others. I don't think we've ever bought a business from a financial operator. Can you think of any Charlie? I can't think of one. Now somebody wants to find hell in a legal system as a place with endless new process and no justice and we're getting close and. And similarly in the corporate world, if you have endless due diligence and no horse sense, you've just described a corporate hell at least for the people who own the business."
My question has to do with Doug Hivester's severance package and what justifies it. Considering he had a very short tenure at CEO and that he took the reins from some very strong performance from Kanzueita to be relieved of his dismal performance by Doug Daff.,"My brother still in the bottling and distribution business of Coke, cut this article from Baudler's World Magazine concerning the severance package. He said he also would retire if he were offered this. 97.4 million in stock, 3 million per year for 2000 to 2002, 2 million per year, 2002 to 2007, 1.4 million per year from 2007 for the rest of his life. Anyway, I don't see how a car and cell phone gets that. That's a Mercury grand marquee and mobile telephones, laptop computer and the like. I don't know why I need that. Anyway, I have been wondering how you voted on this, whether you supported it or not or what degree considering executive pay that Berkshire hasn't risen except perhaps for the CFO who last got to raise I believe in 1997. No, CFO has got to raise every year. But yes, what I supported it is, yeah, I can tell you I supported it because with my 35% interest in 8% of Coca-Cola, I paid almost 3% of it myself personally. I probably paid more severance pay than any man in the history of the world personally. I was not on the Comcommittee, but I will say this. Greg Ibester did all kinds of really wonderful things for the Coca-Cola company over time. For many, many years when Roberto was running things, Doug and working with Don Kio too. I had this first hand from both of them. I wasn't in Atlanta, but there was no question that he was a huge, huge asset and conceived and carried out many of the things that other people may have gotten even more credit for. Most of what you described, not the little things at the end, but most of what you described was contractually in place at the time that he left. I mean, those were deals that were made, restricted stock and all of that that really occurred in significant part when Roberto was the chief executive officer and at Roberto's recommendation. Doug's devotion to Coke is knowledge of Coke. He lived in Aiton and Breath Coke, but in my opinion, Doug Daph was the man for the job and a change was made. It was not because of any lack of attention by Doug Ibester. It was not because he hadn't done great things as CFO of the company. I think he was not the right man at the time. He took over as CEO. He took over, as you know, when Roberto died quite suddenly. There wasn't any real option in terms of the, he was Roberto's hand-picked successor. It's almost inconceivable that somebody else would have been chosen at that time. We made a decision within a couple of years that the company would move faster and better with Doug Daphne in charge and we made a deal in Severance, which was about 80% or some very high percentage embedded. Like I say, I paid more of it than anybody else. It doesn't like it was all academic. I think considering some other factors, which maybe I'll put in a book sometime that entered into it, it was definitely the right decision for the Coca-Cola company, whether the computer should have included the car. I would not want to defend small item by small item, but I think the Coca-Cola shareholders are going to be many billions of dollars ahead over time by what was done then. It wasn't easy to do. We'll go to five. Charlie, do you have anything to add on that? You paid a fair amount, too. Thank you for being speaking. I think it's a mistake for corporate America to create as much hostility as it does, which is based on the way it compensates principal officers of corporations. It is simply maddening to add a little clause that the corporation will scratch the guys back for just tiny little bits of business. It's a lot of stuff that looks terrible. To me, that is extremely stupid. I see it with a corporation that helps him prepare his tax return for 10 years after he leaves and so forth. I think that makes a terrible impression on shareholders generally. I think corporate America is crazy to do it. They get sold this stuff by these damn consultants. I agree with Charlie. It is true. Charlie says, we don't have a contract, at least that I can think of, but at Berkshire, it's perfectly easy to run a company without them. We've got wonderful managers. We've got things that might be called contracts. I mean, we've got deals with them in terms of we tell them what we work out compensation arrangements and all that. I can't remember a case of anybody that's been with us that ever is called an lawyer or anything of the sort or we even had to reduce things to writing basically. It works fine. It is a little maddening as Charlie says. They have a CEO who's show up with a lawyer with a 20 page contract. It's become standard operating procedure and once you get a big public company with the committees, consultants to the committees, consultants who usually are picked by the officers of the company, they look around at what everybody else is doing and say, well, that's the way the other guy does it so I'll do it. I think the proxy statements of the last 20 years, what that's induced in the way of behavior by people at somewhat comparable companies that look at the proxy statements of their competitors and then say to their lawyer, well, Joe Blow got this, why shouldn't I have it? It just escalates and escalates and escalates and it ratchets and it won't stop. I have never seen a compensation consultant come into a public company and suggest a plan that net reduces the cost of compensation. And I see all kinds of people leave companies who have made tremendous amounts of money and nobody wants to hire them at half the price or a quarter of the price or a tenth of the price. It's not a market system. The CEO compensation is not a market system and it's not subject to market tests and I don't know what you do about that particularly but it doesn't seem to bother shareholders very much. The ones that could change, they could bother them a lot more. They feel powerless. Yeah, but institutional shareholders could change that. My guess is that the top 30 institutions probably control what, two thirds of the big companies in the country and they don't seem to care that much. Actually they spend their time on what I regard as peripheral issues usually. They talk about other things. They get involved in rituals of corporate governance that frankly don't mean a damn in terms of how the company performs and they seem to ignore these other issues. But you know, we got enough to do running Berkshire so we can't reform the world on that. We will run Berkshire in our actual manner and we have yet to hire a compensation consultant and we've yet to lose an important manager."
"Recently, Mr. Philip Fisher died. At this meeting many years ago, you, Mr. Buffett, mentioned your fondness for chapters 8 and 20 of the intelligent investor, the first edition of Security Analysis, and you said, fill Fisher's first two books. And you, Mr. Munger, have also been complimentary to Mr. Fisher's writings and investment approach. I wonder if the two of you would tell us of your experiences with Mr. Fisher, the circumstances of your meeting, etc. and did his writings or your discussions with him start you thinking about the idea of the great business or the franchise company or was it simply an affirmation of thoughts which you had already begun to have? And anything else you would like to say about Mr. Fisher?","Yeah, fill Fisher was a great man. He died maybe a month ago where there are abouts. And I've wellened those 90s. His first book, I believe it was Common Stocks and I'm Common Profits, was written in 1958. And the second book was written a few years later. Those two books were terrific books. And as with Ben Graham, you could really get it all by reading the books. I met Phil Fisher just once and it was great. I enjoyed it. I loved it. It was nice to me. But similarly, actually to my experiences with Ben Graham where I worked for him and took his class and everything else, it was in the books. I mean, they were such good writers and their thoughts were so clear that you didn't need to meet them personally. I enjoyed meeting them personally, obviously. But they got it across in words. And the only time I met Phil was sometime after that 1962 book or whatever it was, 61 or 62. And I was in San Francisco. I think it was in the Rust Building. I may be wrong on that. And I just went there. I used to do that all the time when I was younger. And I'd go to New York and I just drop in on all kinds of people. And I guess they thought because I was from all more of that one time and they'd be rid of me. And I would usually get in to see him. And Phil, I did that with Phil. And it was extraordinarily nice to me. But it wasn't that I gained new ideas, though, however by meeting him. Because I'd already read it in his books. And Charlie actually, I met Charlie in 1959. And Charlie was sort of preaching the Fisher doctrine also to me, a little different form, but his ideas paralleled those of Phil. So I was sort of getting it from both sides and made a lot of sense to me. I don't know what Charlie's experience is of where we're with Phil. Well, I always bike it when somebody attractive to me agrees with me. And therefore, I've got very fond memories of Phil Fisher. The basic idea of it was hard to find good stocks. And it was hard to find good investments. And you wanted to be in good investments. And therefore, you just find a few alone that you know a lot about and concentrate on those seem to me. Such an obviously good idea. And indeed, it's proved to be an obviously good idea. And yet, 98% of the investing world doesn't follow it. That's been good for us. It's been good for you."
"My question is, if Ellen Greenspan decided to retire and that job was offered to either of you, would you take it?","Well, I can tell you my answer is no in a hurry. I think Charlie will give you his answer. So I would say no more quickly. You notice we gave you very unequivocal answers and of course that alone would just qualify us from the job at the Fed. I think I think it was Ellen that said to one senator, he said since you've seen you've stated my remarks so accurately, you must have misunderstood them. I don't think you could find a job in public life that wouldn't tie you to either one of us. The truth is we're having too much fun. We've got the best job in the world. We get to work with people we like and admire and trust every day of the year. We get to do what we want to do the way we want to do it. We should pay and this is true of some other CEOs too, but we should pay to have this job. It is really interesting. I've often thought if you could get, you know, you had a seal envelope and you had the compensation committee say what they would pay to have the job filled, but then you had the chief executive also say what he would do before he would leave. There would be a huge, huge gap. I mean, it's, they're all kinds of, I mean, it's a lot of fun to start with. Interesting problems that come up with interesting things to do something different every day. You can't beat the job and to get paid for it is just the frosting on the cake. And I don't see any jobs like that in public life myself. And Charlie, if you got anything to add, Charlie takes on these public jobs. He runs a hospital in a few things and he can tell you the wonders of it, Charlie. Oh, yeah. There's an old saying that he lied like a finance minister on the eve of a devaluation. I never wanted to have a job where lying was a required part of the activity."
"I'm a student in an admirer of your investment philosophy. I have a question. In determining a company's intrinsic value, you seem to write or indicate that you project out a company's owner earnings for a number of years and then discount that back by prevailing rates. My question is, how much of a premium is any to prevailing risk-free rates to the demand when you discount back the owner earnings of a company or state it differently? For example, today with long rates at about 7%, if you did the same exercise with Coca-Cola at what rate of interest would you discount back their owner earnings?","Yeah, we get asked that question a lot and we've answered it to some extent in past annual reports about what discount rate to use. We basically think in terms of a long-term government rate and there may be times when in a very ja… We don't think we're any good at predicting interest rates, but probably in times what would seem like very low rates we might use a little higher rate. But we don't put the risk factor in per se because essentially the purity of the idea is that you're discounting future cash and it doesn't make any difference where the cash comes from a risky business or a safe business, so-called safe business. So the value of the cash delivered by a water company, which is going to be around for a hundred years, is not different than the value of the cash derived from some high-tech company, if any, that you might be looking at, it may be harder for you to make the estimate and you may therefore want a bigger discount when you get all through with the calculation, but up to the point where you decide what you're willing to pay. You may decide you can't estimate it at all. I mean, that's what happens with us with most companies, but we believe in using the, a government bond type interest rate, we believe in trying to stick with businesses that where we think we can see the future reasonably well. You never see it perfectly, obviously, but where we think we have a reasonable handle on it. And we would differentiate, to some extent, we don't want to go below a certain threshold of understanding. So we want to stick with businesses we understand quite well and not try to have the whole panoply with all different kinds of risk rates, because frankly, we think that just be playing games with numbers. I mean, I don't think you can stick something, numbers on a highly speculative business where the whole industry is going to change in five years and have a mean anything when you get through. If you say, I'm going to stick an extra six percent on the interest rate to allow for the fact, I tend to think that's kind of nonsense. It may look mathematical, but it's mathematical gibberish in my view. You better just stick with businesses that you can understand, use the government bond rate, and when you can buy something you understand well, the significant discount then you should start getting excited. Charlie. Yeah, the discounts were once greater than we now see. That's all you got to get folks."
"My question is for Warren, but Charlie, please add your thoughts as well Warren, I've heard you say many times that you don't understand that technology and that you rely and build for that and that's fine And I see from this this year's movie that you're learning so that's good","Slowly, I'm also curious to hear what you've learned so far about the other information information technology companies such as IBM some Micro system Oracle Dell EMCA and Intel I know what I've learned is I know enough not to know that I don't know enough to make the investment decision the Charlie and I have circles of competence that Extend to evaluating a number of types of businesses and there are a whole lot of businesses that we won't be able to evaluate Some of them I don't think I think very few people can evaluate. I mean you get outside of You just get into businesses that where the future is so likely to be different than the present That maybe there's a few people have great insights on it, but we sure don't We are best at the businesses where we can come to a Judgment that they're going to look a good bit Like they do now five years from now 10 years on they'll be bigger. They'll be doing different things But the fundamentals will be the same This car will be a bigger company five years from now Maybe a much bigger company and we may get a chance to do interesting acquisitions, but what you saw there the fundamentals Won't change the way that people think won't change I can name another businesses that are bound to change dramatically I mean when you think of how much the telecom business for example that changed over the last 15 or 20 years. It's it's startling Even with hindsight, you know, it's a little hard to figure out, you know, who's gonna make all the money and so on it It's there's just there's just games that are too tough Charlie says, you know We've got three boxes at the company in out in too hard and a lot of things end up in the too hard pile and and it doesn't bother us You know, we don't have to be able to do everything well if you go to the Olympics And if you run the hundred meter well, you don't have to throw the shot put you know some other guy I'm throwing the shot putting you still got a gold ribbon, you know, if you run the hundred meter fast enough so we We try to stay within the circle of competence Tom Watson senior. I think it was senior. Yeah, Tom Watson senior many years ago said I'm no genius But I'm smart in spots and I stay around those spots Well, that was pretty damn smart, you know, and and we have found a lot of our managers Who don't think you know they can solve every problem in the world, but they run their businesses extraordinarily well I mean you do not want to Frank Martin mentioned for us River you do not want to go and compete with Pete legal in His business. He's gonna kill you, you know, and they he's very very very good But he doesn't come around and try and tell us how to run the insurance business. That's that's not his game We look for people that are very good at at things they understand and and and we don't get any inferiority complex at all about the fact that Well, I you mentioned Intel, I believe I was Virtually there at the birth of Intel because I was on the board of Grinnell and Bob noise was the chairman of the board of Grinnell and We bought at Grinnell we bought three hundred thousand dollars worth of their original adventures and You know, I knew Bob I was a very very smart guy But I wouldn't have had the faintest idea how to evaluate the future of Intel then and I really don't have it now, you know, and I think they probably had a few surprises themselves in the last Two years with with AMD and what's been happening in their business, but how about that's gonna look like in five years? I don't have any idea and I'm not so sure if you're in the industry you know exactly what it was gonna look like in five years It some businesses just are very very hard to predict surely Yeah, one of the foreign correspondence last year after Looking at us carefully said in effect You guys don't seem smart enough to do so much better than other people as you're doing Was he looking in here you Charlie? Have you got an explanation And we said We know the edge of our competency better than most people do It's a very useful thing to Know the edge of your competency and I always say it's not a competency if you don't know the edge of it"
"Irrespective of the interest rate, I have two small questions. Firstly, with the speculation, and some would say rampant speculation in the high-tech and internet arenas, could you share your views on the potential fallout from this speculation for the general economy? And secondly, how long does it actually take you to perfect that curveball? And are we going to see it tonight?","I don't think I want to give anything away about my pitches tonight. Or Ernie Banks, maybe in the audience. I know he's in town, and I just can't afford to do that. But you'll see it tonight, and you can describe it anyway you'd like. The question about the high-tech stocks and possible fallout. Anytime there have been real bursts of speculation in the market. It does get corrected eventually. Ben Graham was right when he said that in the short run, it's a voting machine, and along with it's a weighing machine. Sooner or later, the amount of cash that a business can just gorge in the future, governs the value it has, that the stock demands in the market. But it can take a long time. It's a very interesting proposition, for example. If you take a company that in the end never makes any money, but the trade changes hands representing evaluation of $10 or $20 billion for some time. There's no wealth created. There's a tremendous amount of wealth transferred. And I think you will see when we look back on this era, you will see this as a period of enormous amounts of wealth transfer. The only wealth creation comes about through what the business creates. There's no magic to it. If a company that's not worth anything sells for $20 billion, at 5% of it changes hands. Somebody takes a billion dollars from somebody else. But investors is a whole gain nothing. They all feel richer. It's a very interesting phenomenon. But they can't be richer except as a group unless the company makes them richer. And it's the same principle as a chain letter. If you're very early on a chain letter, you can make money. There's no money created by chain letters. In fact, there's the fictional cost of embeleulps and postage. So the net, there's some money destroyed a little bit. And there's money destroyed by the fictional costs of trading and investing. That comes out of investors' pockets. But the media is that periodically take place. And not just in stocks. We had a similar, or a mania. I'm not necessarily similar. We certainly had a mania in farmland here in Nebraska 20 years ago. And land, which couldn't produce, will say more than 70 or 80 dollars in acre would sell for 2000 and acre at times when interest rates were 10%. Well, that, that math will kill you. And it killed the people who bought it for those prices. And it killed a great many banks here in Nebraska who lent based on that sort of thing. But while it was going on, everybody thought it was wonderful because every farm was selling for more than the similar farm it sold for a month earlier. And it was a moment I'm investing in farmland. And in the end, valuation does, does count. But it can go on a long time. And when you get a, when you get a huge number of participants playing with ever increasing sums, you know, it creates its own apparent truth for a, can be for a very considerable period of time. It doesn't go on forever. And, and whether it, whether it has fallout to the whole economy, like it probably did in the in the late 20s, or whether it's just an isolated industry with a, or, or sector where the bubble burst and really doesn't affect other values. Who knows. But five or 10 years from now, you will know, Charlie. Well, I think the reason we use the phrase, wretched excess is that there are wretched consequences. If you mix the mathematics of the chain leather or the Ponzi scheme with some legitimate development like, developing the internet, you are mixing something which is wretched and irrational and has bad consequences with something that has very good consequences. But, you know, if you mix raisins with turns, there's still turns. Um. That's why they have me write the annual report."
You've emphasized the importance of the most around the business or the sustainable competitive advantage. My question really relates to learning more about that. Professor Michael Porter at Harvard has made a detailed study of this. Did you find his work useful and can you recommend any other sources of information on this?,"Yeah, I've never really read Porter, although I've read enough about him to know that we think alike in a general way. So I can't refer you to specific books or anything, but my guess is that what he writes would be very useful for an investor to read. I mean, again, I never, I've just seen him refer to in some comment theory, but I think he talks about durable or sustainable competitive advantage as being the core of any business. And I can tell you that that is exactly the way we think. I mean, that in the end, you, if you were evaluating a business year to year, you want to, the number one question you want to ask yourself is whether the competitive advantage has been made stronger and more durable before it? And that's more important than the P&L for a given year. So I would, I would suggest that you read anything that you find that's helpful or actually the best way to do it is study the people that have achieved that and ask yourself how they did it and why they did it. I mean, why is it that in razor blades, which I mean, everybody grows up in business school hearing that as a great example of a product that's very profitable and why with it obvious that there's going to be no reduction in demand for the next 100 years for the product, why are there no new entrance into the field? What, what is it that gives you that moat around the razor blade business? I normally, if you got a profitable business, you know, a dozen people want to go into it. If you've got a fresh shop here and down and it looks like he's doing well, you know, a couple of other people going to open up a shop next door to it. And here's a worldwide business. Nothing can go wrong with the demand to speak of. And yet people don't go into it. So we like to ask ourselves questions like that. I mean, we like to ask ourselves why was state farm successful, you know, against people that had incredible agency plants and lots of capital. And here's some farmer out in Blueington, Illinois, James George, my hurl, you know, who's in his 40s. Sets have accompanied the defies capitalistic imperatives. I mean, it has no stock. It has no stock options. It has no big rewards. It's, you know, it's kind of half socialistic. And all it does is take 25% of the market, you know, away from all of these companies that always characteristics, we believe you should study things like that. We think you should study things like Mrs. B out at the Nebraska furniture market, who takes $500 in terms of, you know, over time, and to the largest home furnishing store in the world, there has to be some lessons and things like that. What gives you that kind of a result? And that kind of competitive advantage over time. And that is the key to investing. I mean, if you can spot that, particularly if you can spot it when others don't spot it so well, you're on the, you know, you will do very well. And we focus on that, Troy. Yeah, it's these factors. Every business tries to turn this year's success in the next year's greater success. And they all use pretty much every advantage they have in every direction from this year to make next year's better. Microsoft did exactly that year after year after year, and happened to win big. And it's hard to see, for me at least, to see why Microsoft is simple because they tried to improve the products all the time and make next year's business position stronger than last year's business position. All right. If that's a sin, every subsidiary of Berkshire is a sinner. I hope. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We declare ourselves for sin."
"Large airlines are in the news negotiating labor contracts. They claim they can't pass along rising labor costs to their customers. In the annual report, you say executive jet is growing fast and doing great. Executive jet seems to be able to pass along its rising labor costs to its customers. Is this because executive jet has a rational compensation plan that keeps employees salaries in line with billable services? If not, why does executive jet do well while the airlines experience troubles? Well, the big problem with the airlines is not so much what their aggregate payments will be.","The real problem is when you're in the airline business and your wage rates are out of line with your competitors. When you get right down to it, the figure to look at with an airline among a lot of other things, but you start with the cost for available seat mile and then you work that through based on the capacity utilization to get to the revenues or the cost for occupied seat mile. And you can have labor costs or any other cost. You certainly have fuel costs up dramatically for the airlines from a couple of years ago. As long as you're more efficient than your competitor and your costs are not higher than your competitor, people will continue to fly. It's when you get your cost out of line with your competitor, which was the situation that, or Charlie and I were directors of US Air, a few years back, and our cost per seat mile were far higher than competitors. And that was fine where we didn't have competitors on some many of the short routes in the east, but as a southwest airlines would move into our territory and they had costs, we'll say, and is from memory, but they might have had costs of below eight cents a seat mile. Our cost might have been 12 cents a seat mile. You know, that is, you're going to get killed eventually. They may not get to this route this year, but they'll get there next year or the year after. So if you're running a big airline, a Delta or United or whatever, if your costs are on parity or less labor costs than your other major competitors, that is much more important to you than the absolute level. And the NetJets service is not really designed to be competitive with the United Airlines or an American or something of that sort. It has a different group of competitors. And I think we have a absolutely terrific pilot force there, and we want them to be happy. But there's a lot of other ways. I mean, you want to pay them fairly, but with our pilots, for example, it's extremely important to them in many cases to be able to live where they want to and to work the kind of shifts that we can offer. So we attract them in many other ways than bidding against United Airlines or American Airlines. Big thing, and you just, you can't take labor costs that are materially higher than your competitor in a business that has commodity-like characteristics such as airline seats. You just can't do it over time, and you can get away with it for a while. But sooner or later, the nature of a capitalist society is that the guy with the lower costs comes in and kills you. The airline unions are really tough, and it's interesting to see a group of people that are paid as well as airline pilots with such a brutally tough union structure. That really makes it hard in a commodity-style business, and no individual airline can take a long shutdown without having. Considerable effects on habit patterns and future prospects. It's just a very tough business by its nature. Passing your rail travel, even in a previous era, was a pretty tough way to make a book. Nothing is all that different with the airline travel. We hope that our services are preferred by customers more than one airline seat is preferred compared to another. Fraction ownership is not a commodity business. It's not a commodity-like thing. I don't think that if you were buying a parachute, you'd want to take a little bit. The big commercial airlines with millions and millions of passengers, people, I think, probably correctly assume that there's quite a similarity in both service and safety. If you're in a business that cannot take a long strike, you're basically playing a game of chicken with your librarians, because they're going to lose their jobs too if you close down. You're playing a game of chicken periodically. There's a lot of game theory that gets involved. To some extent, the weaker you are, the better your bargaining position is. If you're extremely weak, even a very short strike will put you out of business. The people on the other side of the negotiating table understand that. It is no fun being at a business where you cannot take a strike. We faced that one time back in the early 80s when we were in kind of a death struggle in Buffalo with the courier express. When I bought the Buffalo news, it was actually Charlie that he was stranded there during a snowstorm and he got bored. He called me and said, what should I do? I said, what do you mind if we'll buy the paper? We were in this struggle. When we bought the Buffalo news, we had two questions of the management. One of them, I can't tell you. The second one was we wanted to meet with the key union leaders and we wanted to tell them, look it. If you ever strike us for any significant length of time, we're out of business. You can make our investment valuable. We really want to look you in the eye and see what kind of people you are before we write this check. We had a good situation in 1981 where a very small union, less than 2% of our employees, struck over an issue that the other 10 or 11 unions really didn't agree with them that much on. They struck the other unions observed the picket line which you would expect them to do in a strongly pro-union town such as Buffalo. I remember they struck on a Monday and I remember leaders of some of the other unions actually with tears in their eyes over this because they could see it was going to put us out of business. Frankly, I just took the position and I said, look it, if you come back in a day, I know we're competitive. If you come back in a year, I know we will not be competitive. If you're smart enough to figure out where exactly the point is that you can push us to and still come back and we have a business and you have jobs, I said you're smarter than I am. Go home and figure it out. They came back in on Thursday and we became very competitive again. It was out of my hands. I couldn't make them work and if they decided they were going to stay out long enough, we were not going to have a newspaper. That's the kind of situation occasionally you find yourself in and I would say the airline industry is a good example of people finding themselves in that position periodically. Charlie, anyone? Well, the shareholders may be interested to know these will be competitive advantages in our net jets program. At the day that other charter plane crashed in Aspen, net jets refused to fly into Aspen at all. People remember that kind of thing."
"What I wanted to know was how you think about how large a position you're willing to take in a given security, both in your case where you have you cash coming in that you can invest and in a case of an investor where they have a fixed amount of capital and they're trying to decide what's the most takes you put in the security that they really love.","Well, Charlie and I have probably at our present size we will never find anything that we get as much money into as we want. I think that's probably true, Charlie. If we really like it. Yeah, I think that's quite like it. Yeah, so we will probably never hit the limit. We would we would love to we'd love to find something we felt that strongly about and occasionally we do but we won't we won't get as much money into it as we would wish or as if we were running a million dollars of our own money or some number like that. So we are willing to put a lot of money into a single security. When I ran the partnership the limit I got to was about 40% in a single stock. I think Charlie when you ran your partnership you had more than 40% and sure and we would do the same thing if we were running smaller partnerships or our own capital we were smaller and we were running that ourselves because now we're not going to do that unless we think we understand the business very well and we think at the the nature of the business what we're paying for it the people running it and all of that lead up to virtually no risk and but you find those things occasionally and we would put assuming it with that much more attractive than the second third and fourth choices we would put a big percentage of our net worth in it. We only advise you to do that probably don't advise you to do it at all maybe but but we would only advise you to do it if you're doing it based on your own conclusions about your own ideas of value and something that you really feel you know enough to buy the whole business if your funds were sufficient it was being offered to you ought to really understand the business but people do that all the time incidentally and private businesses which have got terrible prospect I mean by by dry cleaning establishments or filling stations or whatever and they put very hyper franchises of some kind they put very high percentage of their net worth into something that business is very risky basically. I mean it it people put all their money in a farm you know it's a business it's subject to all kinds of business risks so it's it's not crazy if you understand the business well and if the price is sufficiently attracted to put a very significant percentage of your net worth in if you don't understand businesses then you're better off diversifying and and fairly widely diversifying so sorry. Berkshire has a substantial share over who's father accumulated the original position and when he died he left a very largest state practically all of which was in two securities Berkshire and one other outstanding company and a bank was co-trustee and the bank crossed off with her said you've got to diversify this and it was a very largest state and the young man who was co-trustee with the bank said well he says no my father had believed the way you do he might have been a trust officer in a bank instead of leaving this largest state and that young man holds the Berkshire to this day and I suppose the bank is still giving the same advice down to"
"My statement is you have often written and referenced the aggregate corporate profitability remaining fairly consistent in the long run, such that return on equities are in the 12% range for US companies. And aftertack, Proposive percentage of GDP is sticky in the 4 to 6.5% range. And the question is, given the advances in technology that brought the inventory to sales ratios down historic lows, given the widespread adoption of the EVA principles by companies, might you think that might change over time?","Yeah, I don't think any of the factors that you mentioned will act to move corporate profitability out of the range that is historically existed. It's going to bob around, obviously, some, but I certainly don't think EVA will do a thing for American corporations in terms of making them receive a greater share of GDP and profits. Technology, that's just as likely to reduce profits as to increase profits. I mean, as the economic machine of the United States works better and better over time, the main beneficiaries are going to be consumers. If you took whoever you think is the best business manager in the United States, and you put a clone of that person in charge of each one of the Fortune 500, the profits of the Fortune 500 would not necessarily go up because there's this competitive nature to capitalism where the improvement you get one day, your competitor gets the next day, and it very much tends to work to the benefit of consumers, but not to increase overall profitability. We see that in the industries. We're in the textile business for a long time, and various new products or various new machinery would come along, and it would promise to deliver a 40% internal rate of return and get rid of 43 employees or something like that. We just did one after another, those and we got all through, we didn't make any money because the other guy was doing the same thing. And I likened to everybody to prayed, a huge crowd watching it, and somebody stands up on tiptoes, and buddy on the crowd is up on tiptoes, and they're not seeing any better, and they're like, sure. Well, that was the textile business. And there's an awful lot of self-neutralizing things in capitalism, so I don't really expect any of the factors you named, or any other factors that I can think of that will move profits up as a percentage of GDP. And indeed, I think that if you're looking at GDP as being the national pie, and profits being what investors get out of it, and the rest belonging to people who are out there working for a living every day, I don't think the relics of the proportions are inappropriate, Charlie. I've got nothing to add to that."
"about four or five years ago, I put most of my family's portfolio, actually all of it into a virtue halfway. And over the past four or five years, the stock price has remained rather steady. And I've withstood the year 2000 when friends were making 50% and was losing 50% on my investment. But I have to admit, when I read your fortune article last year and you referred to the stock price as expensive, I felt badly. Now, I spend my days sometimes having fun figuring out the value of virtue halfway. But at night after that comment, I could also wake up in worry and fret. And I realized you talked recently a lot about the qualitative and quantitative aspects of things. And I guess I would like you with your self-reflective position and knowing that I'm asking you to do something like maybe talking about your breathing. What went into that comment to call the stock price expensive in terms of your weights and measures? What price, what value? What do you think about the company and its stock price when you say it's expensive?","I think if you... I don't remember the exact wording of that article, but I'm quite sure that I told the author of that article and I'm almost positive it was in the article that I thought it was more attractive than owning the general market or the S&P. So I was saying that I preferred it to the general market. I'm certainly happy having 99 and a large fraction percent of my net worth in it. I've never sold a share. I am not the least bit uncomfortable about holding it until the day I die and quite a bit thereafter. But I have not thought stocks were cheap at all for some time. And I've never wanted to encourage anybody, particularly in the last few years, to buy Berkshire or any other stock. Because the market, I felt that we had a great bubble. And I think Berkshire's value has improved. I think Charlie does, too, fairly significantly in recent years. And if I had a chance to swap tax-free, my Berkshire for the S&P 500 or for any mutual fund or anything, I wouldn't give it a thought. But that does not mean I think either Berkshire or Stocks are cheap. Charlie. I've got nothing to add to that. I don't think we've ever recommended the purchaser or sale of Berkshire. I can remember we did say at one time we would repurchase shares, which has a certain underlying message to it. And we said, at other times, we wouldn't buy shares. That doesn't mean we'd sell shares at all. But we wouldn't have bought them under the prevailing conditions. But we stayed away from recommending actually not only the purchaser or sale, not only a Berkshire, but just of any other specific shares. We've only given our views occasionally on what we think about the level of the stock market generally. But I do think if you go back and look at that article, I wish I had it here. But I think you'll find that I said I preferred it to equities generally. I do think that there's a lot to be said for developing a temperament that can own securities without fretting. I think that the fretful disposition is the, it's an enemy of long-term performance. Well, it's almost, I think it's almost impossible if you're going to do well in equities over a period of time. If you go to bed every night thinking about the price of them. I mean, Charlie and I, we think about the value of them. But we would be happy just as in that movie if they closed the stock exchange tomorrow. Dick Grasso wouldn't be happy and Jimmy and Goliar, our specialists wouldn't be happy. It wouldn't bother me and Charlie at all. We would keep selling Berks, selling Delhi bars, selling candy, and insurance. You know, a lot of people have private companies and they never got a code on them. You know, we've bought C's candy in 1972. We haven't had a code on it since. Does that make us wonder about how we're doing with C's candy? No, we looked at the company results. So you, there's nothing wrong with focusing on company results. Focusing on the price of a stock is dynamite because it really means that you think that the stock market knows more than you do. Now, if the stock market may know more than you do, but then you shouldn't be in stocks. I mean, you should have the stock market is there to serve you and not to instruct you. So you need, you need to formulate your ideas on price and value. And if the price gets cheaper and you have funds, you know, logically you should buy more if it and we do that all the time. Where we make our mistakes, frankly, is where we focus on price and value and we start buying and the price goes up a little and we quit. You know, like Charlie referred to, we might have done on C's candy. A mistake like that costs us $8 billion in the case of Walmart stock a few years ago because it went up in price. And, you know, we are not happy when things were buying go up in price. We want to go down and down and down and we'll keep buying more and hopefully we won't run out of money. Of course, that's a different story."
"Warren, my question for you in this in regards to your recent charitable gifts. I am as a father of five daughters, perplexed and upset that one, or I've read that one, or more of these foundations, is a big supporter of plan parenthood and abortion rights. I was hoping that you could speak to the billions of dollars that's been allocated with an agency as plan parenthood that is very well funded.","Yeah, well, I'm glad to speak to you. I think it's a terrific organization. And I really think it's too bad that for millennia, you know, women, not only in the United States, but all over the world, you know, have had involuntary bearing of babies forced upon them and usually by a government run by men. So I don't think we want to get into a, we don't want to get into a cheering contest here, but, you know, I think that it's a very important issue. I think it tends to have a small, natural funding constituency because it isn't a popular type thing, where it's like sticking your name on a hospital or something like that. But I would say that if we'd had a Supreme Court with nine women on it, starting when the country became the United States, that by now, I don't think a question like yours, but I think it's a great way to make sure that the people in the United States, you know, men set the rules for a lot of years. And I think it's wonderful that a woman can make reproductive choices, but, you know, you've got a lot of people to disagree with me on that. I've got a lot of people to agree with me on it, and I hope you'll respect my opinion as I do years. I hope you'll respect my opinion as I do yours."
"I want to join the other shareholders in thanking for the results you've achieved, but also for the example that you've set for business generally. My question is about float proceeds and whether they can go into common stocks, you've been asked that question before and prior years once. I asked you something on that and I think at least one of their shareholders has. But I'm wondering if you might go into a little more detail. If I've understood you in the past, you've said yes, you can float available to go into common stocks.","I think it's an important question because it affects the intrinsic value of that float. If that float is locked into fixed income, it's worth one thing. If it could go into stocks at one point, it's obviously worth quite a bit more. What I've had trouble understanding is I think you must have some way that you can guarantee that the policy holders will be protected. Obviously, you can invest everything in a low market and the market goes even lower. If it's simply the size of the capital you've got, that you think that they're extraordinarily unlikely or do you use future insurance revenues, premium revenues to pay off claims with you borrow to pay off claims, if you could give some detail on that, maybe we could share it. Sure. Comfort is how you're thinking about that. The float in no way is limited to fixed income securities. The float is really available for anything that we feel is the most intelligent at any given time. The reason we can say that and other insurance companies can't say that is because we have an incredible abundance of capital plus other streams of earning power, which are unrelated to the insurance business. We could have the float entirely in equities and we have had that in the past. We can have a lot of it in operating businesses. We can have it in any place that makes the most sense. The only reason we can do that is because we have extraordinary capital and we don't have much debt. We run the business differently than or think about it differently than probably 90% of management's do. We look at the assets on a consolidated basis with a few little exceptions. We look at the asset and the liability side completely absent any linkage for specific assets and liabilities. Our job at Berkshire is to get the liabilities as cheaply as possible. We want all the liabilities we can get and not have any worries about fulfilling as cheap as we can plus a lot of capital. Then we want all the assets to be employed as intelligently as possible. We don't match up a billion dollars of asset on the asset side against a billion of specific liabilities on the right hand side. There's one or two exceptions to that but that's what we're required to but that's the basic approach. Charlie and I think about Berkshire were thinking about how do we get as much money as we can as cheap as we can without any way in danger in our ability ever to pay anybody under any circumstances and then how do we put it out in a way that we feel the most comfortable on the assets at the best returns. Frequently that will be equities and it has been over the past. Sometimes it won't be. We can't find them but that's the goal and the float is available just like in virtually all cases just like common equity. We don't distinguish those in our mind. That gives us that flexibility, gives us some edge and perhaps quite an edge at times over our competitors. Charlie? Well, yeah, you can see that in the results to date. We have used that edge in the past and we hope to use it in the future."
"You put your toe in the water so to speak with level three when you gave a deal or you know got involved in that deal with them And I'm wondering if there's anything any area in this hollow communications industry that appeals to you now or any specific company that appeals to you Much more importantly, I want to ask about global crossing there in bankruptcy court right now","The US military uses them for communications data telecommunications or something like that There are two companies that want to buy their assets out of the bankruptcy court One is a Chinese company one is a company from Singapore The US is no way Jose. They don't want China to get control of the assets of Global crossing mainly because of the military security In the last week the Chinese company is backed out the Singapore company has come in and said we will buy the 80% stake and The is now available But still if that sale goes through global crossing will not be in US hands Part of my concern is if these two companies were in a relationship that was friendly they were willing to be together I can see the possibility that they would the Singapore company would sell later It's portion to the Chinese company Have you ever considered and if not why not Buying the assets out of the bankruptcy court, which would be a fire sale. I think that would be good for Berkshire Hathaway In addition, it would be good for US the United States and for future generations I would suggest that would be your civic duty gentlemen Well, I hope I don't get arrested for leaving without doing this I Frankly, I don't have the faintest idea how to evaluate Telecommunications companies down the road that doesn't mean I don't Understand at all what they do. I probably understand a little bit of what they do but in terms of figuring out The future economics in that business What they're gonna look this player or that player is going to look like five or ten years down the road I simply don't know I mean and And I think it's it looks like the people who thought they knew three or four years ago didn't know either I might add but that's another question. I We you know, Charlie. What do you know about the telecommunications business? A little less than you do He's in trouble No, we we don't have any idea You know if you take Pull out a name bell south brighter. I have no idea how that all comes together Five or ten years from now. I mean, I know people are gonna be chewing wriggling chewing gum or eating Hershey bars or Snickers bars Five or ten or fifteen or twenty years from now. They're gonna be using Gillette Blaze They'll be drinking Coca-Cola You know, and I have some idea what the profitability of each one of those will be over time and all of that I don't have any idea I'll tell a communicational Shakes out and and I wouldn't believe anybody in the business that told me they knew because You know what what would they have been telling me five years ago? So it's it's just a game. I don't understand That is why there's all kinds of things I don't understand I don't know what cocoa beans are gonna do next year, you know I mean the a lot easier if I did I could just make all my money on cocoa beans and be much simpler trying to run a whole bunch of businesses at a Berkshire, but there's there's I Don't worry about what I don't know I worry about being sure about what I do know and and telecommunications doesn't fall within that group mostly Berkshire in its history is bought common stocks that practice couldn't fail But occasionally Berkshire just makes an intelligent gamble Where there's plenty of chance of failure, but there's enough chance of success. So the gamble is worth taking and I think it's fair to say that telecommunications falls on that so far. Yeah, yeah We we might buy some junk bonds and that doesn't fact we have several in several areas but As I put in the annual report we expect losses in junk bonds we expect overall the probably are we'll have a we'll have a decent result maybe better than decent but but we do expect losses because we are dealing with institutions that have demonstrated That they don't have large margins of safety in their operations Sometimes not at all in level three, but sometimes we're dealing with managements that are quite suspect and I would say then in the history of global crossing you had that although that doesn't attach itself to the assets now but Very often in the field when people get highly leveraged Sometimes they get tempted to do things that they wouldn't be tempted to do otherwise and and that's happened in the junk bond field obviously and always will happen But that's the reason we expect we expect to have significant losses and actually we we They haven't been that significant. We've had losses and and but though We haven't seen our biggest loss yet believe me and junk bonds, but we'll make a lot of money out of some of them too It's it's a different field. It's like it's like being an insurer of Substandard risk you'll have more accidents, but you can charge your premium that that makes it work out But our business our in general when we buy businesses We want to buy superior risks We don't we don't want to buy a hundred businesses for operation by ourselves with the idea that 15 of them are gonna be Train wrecks and that the other 85 will take care of it."
"Earlier this morning, you made a comment that if the market fell, you would be spending less time on the internet because you'd be very busy. And this is reinforced and impression I have had that the cash flows of virtue have to weigh or enormous, but that possibly in the last 12 months, you've been investing less than you had previously. And if so, if this is correct, what does that say about waiting for attractive values, how long are you willing to weigh, and what does that say to the investment public in their own habits?","Well, you're correct that we have not found anything to speak up in equities in the good many months. And the question of how long we wait, we wait indefinitely. We are not going to buy anything just to buy something. We will only buy something if we think we're getting something attractive. And incidentally, if things were 5% cheaper, that would have 10% cheaper, that wouldn't change anything materially. So we have no idea when that period ends, we have no idea whether, as I've said, it can turn out to these valuations are perfectly appropriate if returns on equity stay where they are, but they are even then they aren't in the least mouthwatering. So we won't feel we missed anything particularly if returns stay where they are, because if it turns out that these levels are okay, they still will not produce great returns from here on our view. That doesn't mean you couldn't have a tremendous market in the short term or something in the short term. Markets can do anything. You look at the history of markets and you just see everything under the sun. But we have no time frame. The money piles up, the money piles up. When we see something that makes sense, we're willing to act very fast, very big, but we're not willing to act on anything that doesn't check out in our view. You don't get paid for activity, you only get paid for being right. Charlie? An occasional dull stretch for new buying. This is no great tragedy in an investment lifetime. Other things may be possible in such an era too. It isn't like we have a quiver with only one arrow. We sat through periods before. I mean the most dramatic one being nearly 70, like 60, nearly 70s. For a long time, it doesn't seem so long when you look back on it. It seems long when you're going through it. But it's like having a tooth pulled or something. But it's, you know, what can you do about it? The businesses aren't going to perform better in the future just because you got antsy and decided you had to buy something. We will wait till we find something we like. We'll love it when we can swing in a big way. That's our style."
I think a lot of people have difficulty valuing businesses because of some convoluted accounting schemes that are out there. Do you have any suggestions in terms of books or something you can read where you can sort of make sense of some of the accounting stories that are going around?,"Well, that's a good question. And a briloff used to write for barons quite frequently on various accounting machinations and barons has continued that somewhat. But you're right that there are people out there who will try to paint pictures with accounting that are something far from the economic reality. And sometimes the rules of accounting themselves lead to that. I would say that when the accounting confuses you, I would just tend to forget about it as a company. I mean, it's probably, it may well be intentional in any event. You don't want to go near it. We have never had any great investment results from companies who's accounting with regard to the suspect. I can't think of a one. No. No. It's a very bad sign. I mean, short sale wants to work out well. In a case like that. It really accounting accounting can be a accounting can offer you a lot of insight into the character of management. And I would say there's a lot, you run into a firm on a bad accounting. You used to call it creative accounting, but you probably went into a lot more. Work was allowed. Some companies have been able to push their auditors pretty far. And I would be very skeptical of anything that looks suspicious to you. I think there have been a couple of things written, but I can't think of where they've appeared, where people talk about the questions of what, obviously, if some prepaid expense deferred asset accounts start building up suspiciously high, and the inventories look out of line with sales and take the trend of them and all of it. You want to look twice at companies like that. Life insurance frequently that we see weak accounting. You can, when you don't have a product where revenues and expenses are being matched up on something close to cash in the short term, you have the opportunity for people playing games with numbers. And some people have learned how to do that very well. And they've sometimes created long-lasting stock manipulation or promotion schemes that have enriched themselves, where they've enriched the managers or the creators of it at the expense of the public over time. You ever get suspicious about accounting, just go under the next company."
"Imagine yourself if you are willing. Cast overnight into a new role with a clean slate as head of the investment committee of a $10 billion pension fund. Today would your decisions reflect the same risk averse mindset that dominated your behavior in the post-1969 period? And might you anticipate that following all of this might appear opportunities that were as mouthwatering as appeared in 73-74? Please explain, and I hope Charlie will weigh in on the subject as well.","when I close up the partnership, if I'd had an endowment fund to run then, the perspective return, and actually I wrote this in a letter to my partners that I'd be glad to send you a copy of. The perspective return, and I was looking at them as individuals on an after-tax basis, was about the same I felt from equities and from municipal bonds over the next decade. And it turned out to be more or less the case. I would say that I do not regard that as being the same situation now. If I were managing a very large endowment fund, for one thing, it would either be 100% of the permanent stocks or 100% of long bonds or 100% in short-term bonds. I mean, I don't believe in layering things and saying I'm going to have 60% of this and 30% of that making them. Why do I have the 30% if I think the 60% makes more sense? And if you told me I had to invest the fund for 20 years and I had a choice between buying the index 500 or 20-year bond, I would buy stocks. That doesn't mean they won't go down a lot, but if you, I would rather have an equity investment. I wouldn't rather have an equity investment where I paid a ton of money to somebody else that took my stock return down dramatically. Simply buying an index fund for 20 years of equities or buying a 20-year bond, it would not be a close decision with me. I would buy the equities. I'd rather buy them cheaper, but I'd rather buy the bond with a bigger yield too. In terms of what's offered to me today, that's the way I would come down, Charlie. Yeah, I don't think that was the answer that was expected, but that's the answer. That doesn't have a thing to do with where we think stocks, or we don't think at all, but where stocks could be or bonds could be into it. We don't have the faintest idea where the S&P will be in three years or where the long term bond will be in three years, but we do know which we would rather own on a 20-year basis. We also expect that the current scene will cause some real disruption. Yeah, but not too many years ahead. That's true, but if you go back 100 years, you can almost say that at almost any period and you will get disruption from time to time, and it's very nice if you have a lot of cash then and you have the guts to do something with it. But predicting them or waiting around for them, that sort of thing is not our game. We bought $5 billion worth of equities in the first quarter or something like that. We don't think there are anything like, they're not, it'd be a joke to even compare them in 1974 or a whole bunch of other periods, but we decided we would rather have them than cash or we would rather have them than sit around and hope that things get a lot cheaper. We don't spend a lot of time doing that. You can freeze yourself out indefinitely. Anytime we find something and what we think is intelligent to do, we just do it. We hope we can do it big."
My question is somewhere I thought I've read that you buy at least one chair of every Company on the New York or on the exchanges to get the annual report Is that true or is that a thing of the past and if it is true? How do you keep track of all that information?,"Well, it's it's it's got an element of truth in it many years ago I did buy one chair of a Great many companies and I'd get these dividend checks for eight cents and ten cents and I used to pay my bridge losses by Giving endorsing these checks by the hundreds and giving them to the people who just won a dollar knee and Then no one asked me to bridge games anymore So I have adopted a new program where I buy a hundred shares of A great many companies I actually I buy them in my foundation so I don't go crazy at income tax time and I probably This is a guess would have a couple hundred companies. Oh, it isn't every company by a long shot But there are at least several hundred companies where I want to be a registered shareholder And to make sure I get the mailings promptly and I I do I do keep those around and I I've very even after I lose interest I very seldom so one so I'll just keep buying more and not only by the 100 shares and something I might want to keep track of but I'll probably buy a hundred shares and all of their competitors and So that I keep reading about those Companies as well. I it it it does pay to have a flow of information come in over the desk"
It's just great Interest rates are the lowest they've been and I think Equity values and aggregate are still high Berkshire has meaningful free cash flow a short duration bond portfolio And your buyer of low-multiple high quality private businesses and a few stocks Assuming that the stimulative economic policy is to deal with the recession eventually cause interest rates to go up and maybe equity values to come down Berkshire seems very well positioned to benefit. Would you comment? And also are there any concerns on both of your parts about Investors inadequately understanding the conglomerate structure of Berkshire and then therefore improperly pricing the shares?,"We hope the latter wouldn't be true because we do our best to explain it. I mean I used 14,000 words in the last annual report which caused certain Members of my family to ask what I was getting paid by the word. The we want you to understand Berkshire and I hope that comes through and that's why we have these kind of meetings. That's why we Why we spent a lot of time writing an annual report. We try to tell you what we would like if the position was reversed and if our positions were reversed and We think that the information in the annual report if read by somebody that they have to have some understanding of business and accounting but if they don't You know, nothing is going to help really in terms of helping them with the business. But we think if they have some understanding of it We have given them the information that Charlie and I would need in order to come up with our rough ideas of the valuation of Berkshire and we and we hope we get across what it's all about. You know, there are a lot of companies in Berkshire but it's not important that you understand the nuances of every single one looking at what happens in aggregate in many cases will be will be sufficient in terms of how we're positioned. You know, we have 16 billion of cash not because we want 16 billion of cash or because we expect the interest rates to go up or because we expect equities to go down. We have 16 billion of cash because we don't see anything that makes us want to part with that cash where we feel we're getting enough for our money. But we would spend it we spent a Monday morning on the right sort of a business or even if if we could find equities that we liked or if we could find like last year we found some junk bonds we like we're not finding them this year at all because prices have changed dramatically. So we're not really ever positioning ourselves we're simply trying to do the smartest thing we can every day when we come to the office and if there's nothing smart to do cash is the default option. Charlie. In terms of future opportunities. The issue is is it all likely that there'll be an opportunity like 1973 for. Or 1982 even when equities generally are just mouthwatering. I think there's a very excellent chance that neither one or I will live to see either of those occasions again. If so, Berkshire is not going to have a lot of no-brainer opportunities. We're going to have to grind ahead the way we've been doing it recently, which is not all bad. It's not impossible. We'll get some mouthwatering opportunities. I mean, you just don't know in markets. It's unbelievable what markets do over time. And since you brought up interest rates. You know, in Japan, the 10 year bond is selling the yield 5, 8 of 1%. 5, 8 of 1%. I don't think there's anybody in our annual meeting of 20 years ago, certainly including Charlie and myself. Who would have dreamt the 10 year bond of a country, you know, running a significant deficit would be selling at 5, 8 of 1%. Would you say so, Charlie? What do I ever? But strange things happen, strange things happen. But if that could happen in Japan, something much less horrible for the investing class could happen in the United States. It's not unthinkable. I mean, we could be in for a considerable period when the average intelligent, diversified investor in common stocks using fancy paid advisors just doesn't do very well. But you can argue that if what we warned against and hope doesn't happen with the ribbit, it should happen. It might create enormous opportunities for us in some arena. I mean, you know, we wouldn't need for society. It might very well turn out to be good for us. If you get chaotic markets, you had a somewhat disorganized market in junk bonds last year because there were a lot of them created much faster than the funds available to absorb them were coming in. Now this year, you have just the opposite situation. Money pouring into the junk bond funds, billion dollars a week roughly. And that's changed the whole price situation. The world hasn't changed that much. It's just that the chaos has left the market for those instruments."
it's been said that you're the white night of the investment world because you rescue companies from hostile takeovers. Are there any companies you are now trying to help out and would you please name those companies? You have a cell phone that you're going to place orders with,No we we really you know what we really want to buy our buy-in to us are our wonderful businesses are at least extremely good businesses and we want them to have management we like and we want the price to be attractive and we are not we are not in the business of being white nights we're in the business of being investors and things that look sensible to us. I don't think I've been approached by anybody in connection with that. We do get approached occasionally I should say we we get approached when somebody occasionally it's when somebody has a takeover bid and they say would you like to top it or something to which our answer invariably is no.
"But I wonder if you could elaborate from a risk management perspective. Wall Street and financial planning firms charge a lot of money for their asset allocation models, say 50% stocks, 40% bonds, etc. I know you take a more opportunistic approach to building your portfolio and managing risk as you mentioned by, as you illustrated by your junk bond example. And so I just want you to hammer out how you use price and value as a tool of risk management and asset allocation as opposed to coming out with a preconceived idea of how much should be allocated to each asset class.","Yeah, we think the best way to minimize risk is to think. And the idea that you have, you know, you say I've got 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds and then have a big announcement. Now we're moving it to 65, 35 as some strategy or whatever they call them in Wall Street. I mean, that has to be pure nonsense. I mean, 60, 40 or 65, it just doesn't make any sense. What you ought to do is have your default position as always short term instruments and whatever you see anything intelligent to do, you should do it. And you shouldn't be trying to match up with some goal like that. I found it entertaining. I was just reading yesterday an article. I think it was about the two fellows at Google and all of the problems are going to have because they're each going to get a few billion dollars. And I mean, it was, I mean, I want to send a sympathy card. I was went down to hallmark store because this article went on. They've got this terrible problem and that terrible problem. They're going to need lawyers and they're going to need financial, they don't need anybody. Those guys are smarter than the people that are coming to them and they do not have a big problem. And they're very capable of thinking it through themselves. The people that have the problem are the people who want to sell their services to them and are going to have to convince them that they have a problem. But so much of what you see when you're talking about outside allocations, I mean, it's just merchandising. It's a way to make you think that if you don't know how to determine whether it should be 60, 40 or 65, 35, that you need these people, you don't need them at all in investing. I mean, most of the professionals that tell you that you're going to get in great trouble unless you listen to them and then adopt and sign up for their services. They're good at selling, but it's what my brother-in-law, former brother-in-law that worked at the stock yard used to say with that people would bring in cattle or something. And I'd say to them, you know, how do you get the farmer to employ you to sell the swift or armor or cut a hay instead of the guy right next to you? I mean, you know, it's a cow, it's a cow and armor's going to buy it the same way. And he gave me this disgusted look and he said, Warren, it's not how you sell them, it's how you tell them. Well, there's a lot of that in Wall Street, Charlie. Yeah, people have always had this craving to know the future. You know, the king used to hire the magician or the forecaster or any looking sheep guts or something for an answer as to how to handle the next war. And so there's always been a market for people who reported to know the future based on their expertise. And there's a lot of that still going on. It's just as crazy, this is when the king was hiring the forecaster who looked at the sheep guts. And people have an economic incentive to sell some nostrum. It can be sold over and over and over again, the really interesting figures are when you combine the underperformance of the market, say by the mutual fund industry, which is probably a couple of points per annum. At that understates it. Now if you take all of the investors in the mutual funds who are constantly whipsawing from one fund to another by a bunch of brokers who want commissions, now you take a subnormal performance and it goes down another three or four percentage points due to the shuffling of the mutual fund investments. So the poor guy in the general public is getting a terrible result from contacting the experts. And these guys are heading the scout troop and the community chest drive and are locally reputable people. I think it's disgusting. It's much better to make a living by being part of a system that delivers value to the people who are buying the product. But nobody, nobody, uh, refrains from creating gambling casinos or something on my theory. If it'll work to make money, why do we tend to do it in this country?"
"The first part of the question relates to the fortune article dated 10th of December, you included now shareholder materials. In this article, you mentioned that one couldn't explain the remarkable divergence in markets by differences in the growth of GNP. However, one could explain the divergence by interest rates. The first question I have is this. I wonder if you were to look at the price of gold during the two periods of times you mentioned, that is to say, $9.4864 and $64.81, if explanation could be even more clear.","The logical reason would be why the Dow in 48 was 177, and half the level of 1929, 381 index points, is because of the 71% evaluation of the American dollar from 20.5 cents to 35 cents. Which would put the fair value of the Dow at 166, after factoring in the record 50% of the capital gain of the 1940s that you had mentioned. I grew up in a household and my sister's here, where gold was talked about frequently. So I've been exposed to a lot of thinking on that over the years. I don't really think gold has really, the price of gold, I should say, has anything really to do with the valuation of businesses. It may reflect certain things that are going on in prices attached to those businesses at a given time. But I would not regard, the price of gold is not entered into my thinking in any way, shape or form, in terms of how I value a business today, a year ago, 10 years ago, or tomorrow. When we look at at Larsen Jewel's, the custom picture frame operation, I'm not thinking against, I'm not thinking of that in relating in any way to what gold has done. It's just not a factor with us. Any more than other commodities would be. Whether it's wheat, whether it's cobalbings or whatever, it has a certain hold on some people. But we don't look at it as an interesting investment and we don't look at it as a yardstick for valuing other investments. Charlie? Yeah, Warren is right when he says that interest rates are very important determining the value of stocks generally. I think he's also right when he says gold is very unimportant."
"Mr Buffett and Mr Munger, I'd like to ask you, when you assess a business and derive its intrinsic value, how do you estimate the future growth of the business and how do you decide what margin of safety to use?","There's a future growth in what, John? Well, I have difficulty understanding that question fully. He's talking about how do we combine our estimates of future growth with our passion for having a margin of safety. Surely you can handle that. Well, I certainly handle as well as you can. Every time you lateral is above to me, you know, he calls those audibles. I think you take all of the variables and calculate them reasonably conservatively, but you don't try and put too much windage in at every level. And then when you get all through, you apply the margin of safety. So I would say, don't focus too much on taking it on each variable in terms of the discount rate and the growth rate and so on. But try to be as realistic as you can on those numbers, but with any errors being on the conservative side. And then when you get all through, you apply the margin of safety. Ben Graham had a very simple formula he used for just the most obvious situations, which was to take working capital, networking capital and try and buy it a third off working capital. All that work for him, but that that method sort of ran out of steam when the sub working capital stock disappeared. But it's the same thing we do in insurance. I mean, if we're trying to figure out what we should charge for, we'll just say the chances of a 6.0 earthquake in California. Well, we know that in the last century, I think if there have been 26 or so, 6.0 or greater quakes in California. And let's forget about whether they occur in remote areas, let's just say we were writing a policy to pay off on a 6.0 or greater quake in California, regardless of whether it occurred in a desert and didn't know damage or any. Well, we would look at the history and we'd say, well, there have been 26 in the last century and we would probably assume a little higher number in the next century. That'd just be our nature. But we wouldn't assume 50. If we didn't, we wouldn't run any business. So we wouldn't, we might assume a little higher. I would, if I'm just pricing it myself, I'd probably say, well, I'll assume there are going to be 30, maybe 32 or something like that. Then when I get all through, I want to, I want to put a premium on it that now puts in a margin of safety. And I was at the, if I figured the proper rate for 32 is a million dollars, I would probably want to charge something more than a million dollars to build in that margin of safety. But I don't want to, I don't want to hit it. I want to be conservative at all the levels and then I want to have that significant margin of safety at the end. And I guess that is, I understand the question that's, that'd be my answer, Charlie, you want to get that? Yeah, that, both deep simplicity that I recommended to you says that you can predict out of those 26 earthquakes, how the size will be likely to be allocated. In other words, there's a standard power law that will tell you the likelihood of earthquakes of varying sizes. And of course, the big earthquakes are way less likely than the small ones. So you count them half and you know the applicable power law and you guess as to how much damage is going to, it's not that difficult. But if somebody says they really want to protect against a nine point oh or something like that and then you know, is it one and is it one in 300 years, is it one in a thousand years? You know, way you get really off the data points. But that is not what you're looking at in investments. You don't want to look at the things that are that, you don't want to come up with companies where you make the assumptions that they get that extreme. And you don't have to, that's the beauty about investments. You only have to look at the ones that you feel capable of evaluating and you skip all the rest."
"Could you please comment on any observations that either of you may have concerning executive compensation and optional issuance, a topic that seems to be getting a lot more media attention and are we going to getting a little bit of excesses in that area?","Yeah, there are three or four aspects to that. On the subject of options, I would say that most options are constructed poorly from the standpoint of the owner, but they're constructed very well from the standpoint of the person that receives them, which is not entirely unexplainable because it's a very strange form of negotiation when the beneficiary is the one that also really does all the design and hires the experts to come in and tell them what is good for the company when the expert knows that the guy who signs the check be quite interested also in hearing what's good for him. There's nothing wrong with options per se at all. Frankly, in terms of virtue, it would have been perfectly appropriate if a properly designed option had been given to me or to Charlie. We have responsibility for the whole enterprise and we believe that any kind of performance and incentive for performance should be related to the area in which you have responsibility. We feel that if you want to type us to type 100 words a minute, you ought to pay for typing 100 words a minute, not what the earnings per share were last year. We feel that the salesman gets paid for how many of the product is sold. They should get paid for that and not for some production, quote, is met. So we believe in tying incentive comp to performance for what you have responsibility and there are certain areas of a business that don't lend themselves to that staff, performance and so on. But that would lead to the corollary that the people that are responsible for the entire results of the business is perfectly appropriate to compensate them by options that in some way reflect the performance of that entire business. The trouble is that stock prices reflect other things than the performance of the business. The one thing over a period of time they reflect simply the reinvestment of earnings. I have pointed out in the past that if you gave me an option on your savings account to manage your savings account and you reinvested all the interest, I would take away a significant payment at the end of 10 years simply because you left the interest in with a company that pays no dividend like Berkshire. If you're going to leave all your capital in every year for me to get a fixed price option for 10 years with me and that I was getting a royally on the money that you left with me and I made the choice to have you leave it with me. That does not strike me as equitable. I think any option should have a step up and price that reflects the fact that money is reinvested by the shareholders annually. If somebody wants to pay out 100% of the earnings every year, then I say that you can have a fixed price option if you give me the money every year and you do more with the money that's left with you in the original sum. That's fine but if money is left with someone for 10 years, there's going to be some increase in value even if they spend every day golfing and to give a piece of that away simply to have a royally on the passage of time for them as a mistake. I think options ought to be granted basically at the fair value of the business at the time they're granted. Sometimes that's a market price. Sometimes it isn't a market price but certainly the management of a company would not give an option on their business to some third party at a market price they felt was way too low so I find it a little disingenuous when management say that they're, when they get a takeover bid they say that the companies really work twice that much but they're perfectly willing to issue options to themselves at this price which they say is totally inadequate when the owners get the option elsewhere. But options properly structured for people with a response of elderly for the business I think can make sense and I think that if something happened to me and Charlie that in terms of the manager of the business subsequently if it was structured properly I would not say anything wrong with an option arrangement. We carry this philosophy down to our subsidiaries where they generally have incentive arrangements that relate to the operation of their business but they don't have incentive arrangements that relate to Berkshire overall because if Chuck Huggins does a wonderful job it sees candy as he has done and I fall on my face in terms of allocating capital Berkshire Stock will go no place despite what Chuck does and to penalize him or to tie his rewards to something over at which he has no control I think it's kind of silly so we tie it instead to the operations of the candy business. In terms of overall level of compensation the real the real sin is having a mediocre manager I mean that that is what costs owners very significant amounts of money over time and if a mediocre manager is paid a relatively small sum it's still a great mistake and if they are paid huge sums it's a travesty and that happens sometimes. It's almost impossible to pay the outstanding manager some that is disproportionate to the value of that outstanding manager when you get a large enterprise. Coca-Cola had a market value of $4 billion when Roberta Goysweta took over. It was stagnated during the previous decade under an earlier management despite having the same product and those great mean show green commercials you saw that was mean show green was in the 70s. Teach the world the same commercial was in the 70s all these great commercials but the company didn't do much. Roberta if we'd bought the entire Coca-Cola company I wish we had. In 1981 or two when it came in for $4 billion and we now had a business worth $150 billion Roberta would have earned more money with us than he earned under the present arrangement. Having the right person in place is just enormously important. How much they should take is another question that's more a philosophical question. Tom Murphy, thus manager in the world he just didn't feel like taking a lot of money out of it. I tip my hat to him but I don't think that necessarily makes it wrong for somebody else to take more money for doing the job. I think it ought to be related to doing the job. When I ran a partnership in the 1960s I took a quarter of the profit over 6% a year and I didn't get paid any salary but I could make a lot of money doing that. That thought occurred to me as I ran the place from day to day and I think it probably helped a little. I don't think it's a terrible thing to have somebody get paid for making money for the shareholders but they ought to get paid for really making it not simply because the shareholders reinvest money with them. They ought to make it based on the fair value of what they had when they took over and they ought to make it really for just excellent performance. Charlie? Well, we have remarked in previous Berkshire other way meetings that we regard present mandated corporate accounting with respect to stock options as weak, corrupt and contemptible. And it is. Otherwise we're undecided. If something is so wonderful as a standard technique of compensation, why does it have to be masked under weak, corrupt and contemptible accounting? I think it is no credit to our civilization that we've drifted into this particular modality and you can get if you overuse stock options for the whole thing as sort of a chain letter. In Silicon Valley, this one company that practically paid everybody in options and as long as the chain letter galloped, it worked as far as the income account because nothing went through expense. And then once everybody is issuing stock options, everybody else feels that he has to do it and the practice spreads. So I am not totally wild about the extreme prevalence of the stock option modality in an American corporate life. Personally, I would vastly prefer different modalities which would probably involve stock instead of stock options. I'm all for sharing with the kind of people who are doing the important work pretty well down in the organization at a place like Costco or Coca-Cola or any other such company, but I don't much like the present scheme that civilization has drifted into. With respect to the subject of do we have some regid excesses in American corporate compensation? My answer would be yes. I don't think the excesses necessarily, the guy who got the most money, in many cases, I agree with Warren that the money has been deserved, but such is the envy effect that the practice spreads to everybody else. And then the taxi driver and everybody starts thinking the system is irrational, unfair, crazy. And I think that's what causes some people as they rise in American corporations to, at a certain point of power gaining and wealth gaining, they start exercising extreme restraint as a sort of moral duty. And that's what Warren was saying about Tom Murphy. And I would argue that the Tom Murphy attitude is the right attitude. And it goes way, way back in the history of civilization. The word liturgy comes from a Greek word, which is just the same. I mean, if you were an important citizen of Athens, it was a lot like being an important person in a Jewish culture. I mean, you had duties to give back and to act as a certain example. And the civilization had social pressures that enforce those duties. And I would argue that the Berkshire Hathaway compensation system, considering what the people at the top already have, it would be better if we saw a little more of it. I think Warren and I do all right. A few years ago, I think an added problem is the sort of, in terms of the accounting, the sort of hypocrisy that it pushes people into and then which becomes accepted and sort of a norm, particularly when leaders do it. You had a situation a few years back when there's no question that any manager would say that stock options are a form of compensation. They would say that compensation is a form of expense and they would say that expense belongs in the income account. But they didn't want to have stock options counted because they felt that it might restrict their use. So when the Federal, the FASB, the actual county standards board came up with a proposal to actually have reality reflected in mass corporate chiefs descended on Washington to pressure legislators to have Congress start enacting accounting standards, which I mentioned one time in Indiana in the 1890s. There was a legislator that introduced a bill that had the value of pi changed to an even three because he thought 3.14159 was too tough for the school journey and it would ease computational problems. Well, that sort of behavior by corporate chafedins, when they are in their arguing that the black is white in order to feather their own nests and maybe create little higher stock prices, I think that it means that they forfeit to some degree their right to be taken seriously when they claim they are operating for the good of the republic and march on Washington and other regards. And I just think that when the organization recognizes its hypocrisy and so on, I think there is a degradation that they can set in through an organization that whose leaders are also leaders in hypocrisy. Like I say, we have no strong feelings on this subject. Charlie, do you have any? It's rather interesting though. There's an earlier example, Commodore Vanderbilt took no salary from his railroads. After all, he controlled the railroads. They paid all the dividends that he needed and he got the fond of running the whole railroads and he thought it was beneath Commodore Vanderbilt to take us out. We've never quite reached the Vanderbilt standard. We don't have any dividends, Charlie. Well, maybe that's the reason."
I wanted to find out earlier you mentioned you looked at used filters to look at a company. So could you elaborate on what those filters are?,"Well, we've tried to do a good deal of that. Opportunity cost is a huge filter in life. If you've got two suitors who are really eager to have you, and one is way they help better than the other, you do not have to spend much time with the other. That's the way we filter stock buying opportunities. Our ideas are so simple, people keep asking us for mysteries. All we have is the most elementary idea. The first filter we probably put it through is whether we think, and we know instantly whether it's a business we're going to understand and whether it's a business that if it passes through that, it's whether a company can have a sustainable edge. That gets rid of a very significant percentage of the things people have. They always want to tell you some story and I'm sure they regard me and Charlie as very arbitrary in terms of, you know, in the middle of the first sentence saying, well, you know, we appreciate the call but we're not interested. I mean, they just think if they explain something, and if I get letters on this all the time, we really can tell in the middle of the first sentence usually whether those two factors exist. If we can't understand it, obviously it's not going to have, we can make a decision as to whether it has a sustainable edge. If we can't understand it, we very often come to the conclusion that it's not the kind of business where it will have a sustainable edge. Well, 98% of the conversations we can end, you know, in the middle of somebody's first sentence, which of course it goes over very big with the caller. And then sometimes if you talk about an entire business, we can tell by who we're dealing with whether a deal is ever going to work out or not. I mean, if there's an auction going on, we don't want to. We have no interest in talking about it and it just isn't going to work. If someone is interested in essentially doing that with their business, they're going to sit down or want to renegotiate everything with us all over again after the deal is done and we're going to have to buy the business two or three times before we get through. You just see all these things coming. And on the other hand, we've had terrific experience basically with the people we have associated with. So it works. It's efficient. You know, we don't want to listen to stories all day and we don't read brokerage reports or anything. It's just there's other things to do with your time. Trying to? Yeah. Another pillar that Warren was looting to is this concept of the quality person. And of course, most people define quality person as somebody very much like them. But, it's down to cool. Actually, it's the word we are serving. But there are so many wonderful people out there and there are so many awful people out there and there are signs frequently like flags, particularly over the awful people. And generally speaking, those people are to be avoided. It's just, you're not a misery. You bring into your life by trusting some awful person. And the amount of publicity that you can bring in by making the right business associations look around this room. And there are some wonderful people who have created some wonderful businesses. And the customers can trust them. The employees can trust them. The problems can trust them to be fairly faced and reasonably solved. And those are the kind of people you want. And people will take their promises seriously. I had some experience recently with a company and they have their brand on a particular product. And somebody invented a better product in the same field. And they're taking their brand off their product. And the best, they don't want their brand on. People who think like that frequently do very well in business. And the flags are flying. I mean, they get to, it's like they got to sign in there, just as jerk, jerk, jerk. And then, yeah, and then you think you're going to buy the business now? I'm going to be a jerk, get on anymore. I mean, it's just, yeah. Right. Right at the end."
I'm wondering if you would give us a clue as to what your strategies are going to be if it's really true that the market gets dismal over the next few years?,"Well, if the market gets cheaper, we will have many more opportunities to do intelligent things with money now, whether we'll blow on the money in the meantime or something is another question. But, you know, we are going to be buying things. One thing or another operating business stocks, high yield bonds, whatever, we're going to be buying things for as long as I live, just as long, just like I'm going to be buying groceries. Longer than that one. Yeah. Charlie is just waiting to take over after I hear. And I'm going to be buying groceries the rest of my life. Now, when I rather have grocery prices, go up or down if I'm going to be buying groceries tomorrow and next week and next month, the next year and the answer is obviously if I'm in that buyer, I would do better, give prices are lower. We have no, we're not good at forecasting markets. So, I mean, knew that we were getting enormous bargains in the mid-70s. We knew that the market went crazy to some extent in the in the late 90s. But we don't have much, we don't spend any time. Charlie and I spend no time thinking or talking about what the stock market is going to do. Because we don't know. We do know sometimes that we're getting very good value for our money when we buy some some stocks or some bonds as it may be. But we are not operating on the basis of any kind of macro forecast about stocks. And there's always a list of reasons you gave a few. There's always a list of reasons why the country will have problems tomorrow and there, but there's always a list of opportunities which don't get mentioned quite as often. So, we don't sit on and make a list of the bad things that are happening in the economy and the good things that are happening and therefore expecting the stock market. It might not, it doesn't behave that way even if you could correctly forecast some of the bad things or good things. Overall, I'm an enormous bull on the country. I mean, over time, I mean, this is the most remarkable success story in history of the world if you think about it. I mean, in 1790, we had less than four million people in this country. We had there were two hundred and ninety million people in China. There were a hundred million people in Europe. You know, and they all had the same intellect we had. They were in the same general climate. They had lots of natural resources. And two hundred and fifteen years later, those three point nine million people, I think actually, you know, I have 30% or so of the world GDP. So, it does not make sense to bet against America. That doesn't mean all our policies are smarter or anything. But I would not, I do not get pessimistic on the country. You know, I worry about the big, the big worry is what can be done by either terrorists or government governments that have access to nuclear chemical or biological weapons. But in terms of the basic economics of the country, your children are going to live better than you live and your grandchildren are going to live better than your children live. And we do not focus on macro factors, Charlie. Well, I agree with you that the economics of the country are probably going to increase for a considerable period ahead. But I suspect that in very important ways we are adder near the apex of a great civilization. You heard it here first, folks. If you leave the NCB nuclear chemical biological, but I do not feel that way. But you'll get to see which one I was just right, 20 or 30 years from now. I have seen more people pass up opportunities because they get focused on a single economic variable or a single problem with the country faces. And they forget about the good thing. I mean, if you can buy very good businesses at attractive prices, it's crazy to say, I think I'll sit this out because it might get a little cheaper next year or something of the sort and because the world's going to go to hell. We've never operated. We've never decided not to buy a business we like because of a macro view. Have we? Not yet. Okay. It's hard to get them to really agree with you. I've been working out of for years."
"Can you please share the life and financial concepts that you prefer talking to young people about? Share, do you want to know your life concepts and financial concepts? Are you useful to young people?","Well, that's a fairly broad question, but yeah, I think the financial concepts, you know, we've obviously spelled out in the reports. Charlie's probably better on the life concepts than I am. It is true that I do believe in spending the time that I spend giving talks or answering questions, doing it with young people. I'm sure well over a dozen a year and I just think that obviously young people are more receptive to change or to actually even forming habits that are going to be useful in life. And I think that people underestimate until they get older, they underestimate just how important habits are and how difficult they are to change when you're 45 or 50 and how important it is that you form the right ones when you're young. But Charlie, what do you have to say on that? Well, all the right stuff is what works. I mean, you avoid doing the really dumb things like raising moving trains to the crossing, experimenting with cocaine, risking getting aids or other unfortunate ailments. There's just a lot of standard things that take people down and you just give those a white birth and then you want to develop a good character and good mental habits and you want to learn from your mistakes every single one as you go along. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? We would say even though we issue lots of credit cards, I think we'd say if probably if I had one piece of advice to give to young people, you know, that across the board, it would be just don't get in debt. The game plays a lot easier if you're a little bit ahead of the game and then if you're behind the game and Ben Franklin said that long ago in better terms, which Charlie can recite, but there's a real difference. I get letters every day from people that are in all kinds of financial trouble. Often it's health related, which is tragic, but very often it's it's it relates to debt. I mean, they get behind the game and they're never going to catch up. And often it may surprise you, but often I write these people, they're very decent people. They've just made mistakes and I just tell them the best courses bankruptcy. They they are not going to catch up and they they should start all over again and they should never look at a credit card the rest of their life. But it would have been better if they've gotten that advice a little earlier, but it's it's very tempting to just spend more than your own. I mean, I, you know, it's very understandable. But it's not a good idea. And of course, you particularly want to avoid evil or seriously irrational people, particularly of the air track you'd members of the opposite sex. That can Charlie knows more about the play with the expert. Yeah, you know, it's better to hang out with people better than you. I find that very easy to do over the years, but if you if you're picking associates, pick out those whose behaviors somewhat better the years and you'll drift in that direction. And then similarly, if you if you hang out with a bad bunch, you're very likely to find your own behavior worse over time. But all like Charlie says that the tried advice, which Ben Franklin was handing out a few hundred years ago really works. You know, just we've said, but look at the people you like to associate with, you know, what qualities do they have that that you can't have if you want to look at the people that you can't stand up around what qualities do you have that they have can you get rid of them. You can do all of that at a young age. It gets it gets harder as you go along. It's not it's not very complicated. And my final word of advice would be if this gives you a little temporary unpopularity in your peer group, the hell of them. Because advice a little more apical of man Charlie, I was reading about a woman that was 103 and they said, what do you like about being 103 and she says no peer pressure."
"You have said that you like franchise companies, companies that have that are castles surrounded by modes, companies that are possible to, you can have some prediction five, ten years down the road. But aren't the businesses like C's, Candy, the furniture business, the jewelry business, the shoe business, business that are hard to predict the future five, ten years down the road? Aren't these businesses hard to predict five or ten years down the road?","Things like shoe business. I think they're far easier to predict than most businesses. Telling you the future virtually all of the businesses we have and not just because we have them. If they belong to somebody else, then if I took the Dow 30, excluding the ones we own or the first hundred companies alphabetically on the New York Stocks, I think ours are way easier to predict. They tend to be fundamental things, fairly simple, rate of change is not fast. So I feel pretty comfortable. I think when you look at Berkshire five years from now, the businesses we have now will be performing pretty much as we've anticipated at this time. I hope there are some new ones and I hope there are big ones. But I don't think that will have had lots of surprises in the present one. My guess is that will have had one surprise. I don't know what it will be. I mean, you know, that happens in life. But there won't be a series of them. Whereas if we were to buy a base metals business or many retailing businesses I can think of, an auto business, I'm not sure I know where we would stand in the competitive pecking order five or ten years from now. I would not want to fly and come in and displace C's candies, for example, in the business it does or the furniture market. It's not an easy job. So I don't think you'll get lots of surprises with the present businesses of Berkshire. But the key is developing more of them."
"My question for Charlie is, business school sense, what is the cost of capital for Berkshire Hathaway? My question for Warren is that I've been on the internet, and I look at Yahoo and they give you recommendations for companies, and when I search for Berkshire Hathaway, it shows that nobody is recommending Berkshire Hathaway despite the fact that there are maybe a thousand people that are wearing science here. I love Berkshire Hathaway, and of course I've got mine on too, but what seems to be the problem in lack of recommendations?","Well, we're not recommending Yahoo, incidental either, but then I'll let Charlie have that first question about the cost of capital, which is puzzle people for thousands of years, and then yeah. The way that is taught in most business schools, now I find in Coherent, and so I'm the one that asks that question and gets the end Coherent answers. I don't have a good answer to a question I consider kind of a stupid question. What is the cost of capital that Berkshire Hathaway, when we keep drowning in this torn of cash, which we have to reinvest? There's really only two questions that get to that, but you don't need a mathematical answer. The first question is, is when you have capital, is it better to keep it or return it to shareholders? It's better to return it to shareholders when you cannot create more than a dollar of value with that capital. That's test number one. And if you pass that threshold that you think you can achieve more than a dollar of value for every dollar retained, then you simply look around for the thing that you feel the surest about and that promises the greatest return weighted for that certainty. So our cost of capital is in effect, is measured by the ability to create more than a dollar of value for every dollar retained. If we're keeping dollar bills that are worth more in your hands than in our hands, then we've exceeded the cost of capital as far as I'm concerned. And once we think we can do that, then the question is, how do we do it to the best of our ability? And frankly, all the stuff I see in business schools, and I've not found any way to improve on that formula. Now, the trouble that you may have is that many managements would be reluctant to distribute money to shareholders, even if they would rationalize that they would do better than they then actually do. But that may be a danger on it, but that won't be solved by them hiring a bunch of people to come up with some cost to capital, but also justify some keeping the money. Because that's what the old little otherwise. The question about recommending the stock, we've very seldom had stock recommendations over the years. As I think back to 1965, I can't think of a lot of brokerage reports that have recommended Berkshire. I'm not looking for any reports at all. We are not looking to have Berkshire sell at the highest possible price, and we're not looking to try and attract people to Berkshire who are buying stocks because somebody else recommends them to them. We prefer people who figure out it for themselves. Why they themselves want to buy Berkshire? Because they're much more likely to stick around if they enter the restaurant because they decided it's the restaurant they want to eat at than if somebody has touted them on it. That's our approach. So we do nothing to encourage, but I think even if we did, we probably wouldn't generate a lot of recommendations. It's not a great stock to get rich out of here at brokerage. Yeah, I think the reason... I think one of the main reasons why I saw a little recommended in the institutional market is that it's received this hard to buy on quantity. We prefer, we've got some good institutions as well, one that's run by Berger front of ours, but frankly it's more fun for us to have a bunch of individual shareholders. I mean, you see it translates... If there's money made, it translates into changes in people's lives and not some change in somebody's performance figure for one quarter, and we think that individuals are much more likely to join us with the idea of staying with us for as long as we stay around. And that's the way we look at the business. Very few institutions look at investments that way, and frankly, we think they're often less rational holders than we get with individuals."
"One of the things I find most refreshing and admirable about you as corporate leaders is that you're very candid about making mistakes. And as you put it last year, Mr. Munger, rubbing your noses in it. Last year, Mr. Buffett, you talked about the $10 billion mistake of starting to buy Walmart and then stopping after it had ticked up a little bit. Today, you seem to allude to a somewhat similar mistake. You bought a stake in Petro, China, then after it was disclosed that you owned it, it popped up a bit. And obviously in hindsight, you could have made a lot of money, had you continued buying it. If these emotional traps, I think you called it anchoring it last year's annual meeting, are the traps that even people as experienced as you gentlemen are occasionally fall into. I sort of wonder what hope do the rest of us have. So my question is, you know, how do you, what are the mental tricks you have or how do you overcome these behavioral and emotional traps like anchoring on what advice do you have for us?","Well, that's a good question. And of course, the first question is in recognition of the fact that they can be traps and that you will be affected by them. And you will make some mistakes because of them, but Charlie and his, and poor Charlie's Almanac, which I probably do take credit for the name of. And they, he talks about the various psychological traps that people fall into and simply reading that section, you will come away wiser than, than before you started on it. We will, our personalities are such the Charlie and I probably are a little less prone to some of those mistakes than other people are, but as our record clearly indicates we still are prone to them and we, we make them and we'll make them again. We're probably a little less inclined to make some of them than we were 30 or 40 years ago, but you know, the nice thing about it is though is that if you make fewer of those mistakes than others, you know, they will continue making their share and you'll get very rich. Charlie. Yeah, you don't have to have perfect wisdom to get very rich. All you've got to do is have slightly more than other people on average over a long time. And it's the old story about the guy out running the bear. I mean, I don't have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun that other fellow."
Is there any point at which your stock would rise to the point where you might split the stock?,"Surprise, surprise. I think I'll let Charlie answer that this year. He's so popular with the shareholders, I can afford to let him take the tough questions. I think the answer is no. I think the idea of carving ownership and an enterprise and a little tiny $20 pieces is almost insane. It's quite inefficient to serve us a $20 account. I don't see why there shouldn't be a minimum as a condition of joining some enterprise. Certainly we don't feel that way in a private enterprise. Yeah, we would not carve it up in $20 units. We find it very interesting because every company finds a way to fill up its common shareholder list and you can start with the A's and work through the Z's and every company in the New York Stock Exchange, one way or another has attracted some constituency of shareholders. And frankly, we can't imagine a better constituency than is in this room. We don't think we can improve on this group and we've followed certain policies that we think attracted certain types of shareholders and actually pushed away others. That is part of our Eugenics program here at Berkshire. Yeah, just look around this room and as you mingle with one another, this is a very outstanding group of people. Why would anybody want a different kind of a group? If we follow some policies that cause a whole bunch of people to buy Berkshire for the wrong reason, the only way they buy it is to replace somebody in this room or in this larger metaphorical room of shareholders that we have. So someone in one of these seats gets up and somebody else walks in. The question is do we have a better audience? I don't think so. So I think that Charlie said it very well."
I wanted to ask if you could elaborate upon the logic of adding two family members to the Board of Trustees.,"As I've talked about in the annual report, if I died a night, my stock goes to my wife who is a member of the Board of Directors. And she will own that stock until her death when it will go to a foundation. So there is a desire to have a, as long a term and permanent ownership structure, as can really be done in terms of planning and the tax laws and so on. We have invited people like Hal'sbergs to join in with Berkshire into what we think is particularly advantageous way for them to conduct a business and to know the future that they're joining. And part of knowing the future that they're joining involves knowing that the ownership is stable. And it will be stable for a very long period of time in Berkshire, probably about as long as you can, anybody can plan for in this world. After my death, the family would not be involved in the management of the business, but they'd be involved in the ownership of the business. And you would have a very large, concentrated ownership position going well on into the foundation that would care very much about having the best management structure in place and to in effect prepare for that over time. I think it's very advisable that family members who will not be involved in management, but who will have a key ownership role to play become more and more familiar with the business and the philosophy behind it. I discussed that sum in the, I guess it was the 1993 annual report because I think it's important that you understand. And anybody that wants to sell us a business, if you've built a business since 1915 and you care enormously about it, you care about the people that you've developed, but you've got something else you want to do in life. It's more, you know, than advertising your car in the paper to sell it. I mean, it is an important, very important transaction to you, not just in terms of how much money you receive, but in terms of who you deliver thousands of people that join you, who you deliver them to. And I think we have a structure that is about as good as you can do, nothing is forever, but we have a structure that's about as good as you can do in terms of people knowing what they're getting into when they make a deal with us and being able to count on the conditions that prevail at the time of the deal, continuing for a long period in the future. Many people, I thought tell me the other day about a business where it been wooed by the acquireer and the day after the deal came in and fired the top half dozen people. They had a secret plan all along. Well, I don't think you're running too much of that, but what you do run into is the company, the company that's acquiring company, itself either being acquired or some new management coming along or some new management consultant coming along and saying, well, this doesn't fit our strategic plan anymore, so let's dump this division. And people that join in with Berkshire can be relatively, I think, comfortable about nothing like that happening. Charlie, you want to elaborate on? No. I was hoping Charlie would have a near life experience this morning, but I was hoping Charlie would have a near life experience this morning."
"could you comment on insurance companies taking on credit risk through the sale of credit derivatives, the adequacy of the accounting for these derivatives, and finally, could you explain why the financial guarantee insurers who are the primary sellers of these derivatives have the same AAA rating Berkshire has despite their more than 141 leverage and the correlated nature of the risk that they take on?","Well, I think you should go to work for Standard and Poor's or Moody's. The question about credit insurance or credit guarantees of one sort or another, and that's become very popular and it's become actually popular with sort of the standard insurance property, casually insurance companies in recent years. I would say that in many cases, the people participating in that business don't really know what they're doing. It's so easy in insurance business. It's the curse of the insurance business. It's also one of the benefits of it is that people hand you a lot of money for writing out a little piece of paper. What you put on that piece of paper is enormously important, but the money that's coming in and it seems so easy can tempt you into doing very, very foolish things. We had a situation here in Omaha 15 or 20 years ago in the mid-80s where Mutual of Omaha largest health and accident association in the world at least at one point, and they decided to go into the insurance property, casually insurance business. In a very, very, very short time, they wrote not very many contracts and it resulted in wiping out half of the net worth of everything that had been built up over many, many decades. If you are willing to do dumb things in insurance, the world will find you. I mean, you do not. You can be in a robot in the middle of the Atlantic and just whisper out. I'm willing to write this and then name a dumb price and you will have brokers swimming to you with their fins showing. It is brutal. I mean, if you are willing to do dumb things, there are people out there and it's understandable, but they will find you and you will get the cash up front. You will see a lot of cash and you won't see any losses and you'll keep doing it because you won't see any losses for a little while. You will keep taking on more and more of this and then the roof will fall in. I mentioned in the annual report how Geico had taken in $70,000 of premiums in the early 80s for a few policies and they thought they were just picking cherries at the time and they re-insured a lot of it. So far, we have lost $93 million. The most we could make was $70,000 and I don't know what the most we can lose is, but I know that $93 million has gotten my attention. When you're playing in a game like that, you can't afford to make a mistake. A single mistake or a few mistakes that are correlated, as you have mentioned because these things do correlate, a few mistakes will overcome a lifetime of savings. I mean, it is, you will make a few cents on the dollar when you're right and you will lose incredible sums when you're wrong and credit insurance. When you go around Guarante, a lot of people went around Guaranteeing credits based on ratings and they said, well, we'll guarantee a whole bunch of single-lay ratings or we'll create these structured arrangements that involve a rated credits. And they would use a lot of studies that would show that X percent of a rated credits defaulted per year and you go back to the 30s and all these back-tested arrangements. But the problem with that is that what the question or mentioned is correlation. When things go bad, all kinds of things correlate that no one ever dreamed correlated. What you had, of course, in the debt field was you had a whole bunch of, say, telecoms or energy companies that were all rated similarly, but they were correlated in a huge way and you weren't getting a diversification. You were getting a concentration that you didn't realize and there's nothing more deadly than unrecognized concentrations of risk, but it happens all the time. So I would say we see a B double A credit enhanced to a triple A credit by somebody guaranteeing it and they may guarantee it for 10 or 15 basis points and yet the spread and market yield might be a hundred basis points. That does not strike us as smart. And I would say this about the triple A rating. They have a triple A rating for claims paying, but they don't carry, I don't think, general triple A. There's only, I think eight or nine triple A's left in the United States. Berkshire Hathaway is one of them. But I believe there's only one other insurance company, which is AIG. And then there's a half a dozen other companies. So those companies are not in the same class credit wise as Berkshire nor are they recognize as being in the same class. But I would say you can get into a lot of trouble at 140 to one at some point, ensuring credits, Charlie. Yeah, he also asked about the quality of accounting. And in my view, at least the quality of accounting in America were derivative transactions. It's still terrible. It's terrible in that it's too optimistic. And one of the places where it's most terrible is when you talk about guaranteeing future credits way out years ahead, that's sort of thing just lends itself to people getting very optimistic and their assumptions. And in their audited figures. And people pay attention to the audited figures, not the underlying reality. So therefore, if the accounting is lousy, the business decisions are lousy. And I think that's going on, mightily, as we sit here. Yeah, there are dozens of insurance organizations or trading organizations in the country of the written credit guarantee contracts in derivative form in the last few years. In fact, on a huge scale. I will guarantee you, virtually, that every single one of those contracts that was written in the first week whoever wrote it, you know, recognized some sort of an income account or an income entry. And that somebody got paid a little bit of money for writing each one of them. And you know that many of those are going to go bad. And maybe as a category, that it's going to be a terrible category. But nobody ever wrote a contract and recorded a loss at the time they wrote it. I mean, they just don't do it. And I will tell you that there are a lot of those contracts that somebody wrote them for me. Ten seconds later, I would have paid somebody to take them off my hand. So that I would have regarded them as having a built-in loss. Nobody ever records a built-in loss on a derivative contract. In fact, I find it extraordinary that you have two derivative dealers. And dealer A and dealer B write a ticket. And dealer A records a profit and dealer B records a profit. You know, particularly for 20-year contract, you know. I mean, that is a kind of world I'd love to live in, but I haven't found it yet."
How do barchers and barchers companies protect themselves against lawsuit-happy lawyers? And is it possible for American businesses to survive the financial and time-consuming costs of dealing with lawyers?,"It's a good question, and we've probably had less litigation than any company with a $25 billion dollar mark as I get America. But we were sued one time at Blue Chip Stance. What was it for, Charlie? How many billion by some guys? Lots. Yeah, you cannot protect yourself against lawsuits. And there are certainly a lot of frivolous ones. Like I say, it's not been a drain on our time or money, but particularly time, date. And I think one thing you'd have to do is if you ran into anything of that sort, you would not pay and you would make life as trying to make life comparably difficult for the other barries. They made it for you, but that has not been our experience so far, Charlie. Yeah, well, I can tell an Omaha story on that one, which demonstrates the virtue of a way technique for minimizing lawsuits. When I was a very young boy, I said to my father, who was a practicing lawyer here in Omaha, why do you do so much work for X, who was an overreaching blowhard? And so little work for Grant McFaden, who was such a wonderful man. And my father looked at me as though I was slightly slow in the head and he said, Charlie, he said, Grant McFaden, he's a employee's right, his customer's right, everybody's right. When he gets involved with somebody who's a little nuts, he gets up from his desk and walks to where they are and expirates himself as soon as he can. And he says, Charlie, a man like Grant McFaden doesn't have enough law business to keep you in school. But X, he said, he's a walking minefield of continuous legal troubles. And he's a wonderful client for a lawyer. Now my father was trying to teach me and I must say it worked beautifully because I decided that I would adopt the Grant McFaden approach. And I would argue that Warren independently reached the same approach very early in life. Boy, has that saved us a lot of trouble. That is a good system. You can't, we basically have the attitude that you can't make a good deal with a bad person. And that means we just forget about it. I mean, we don't try and protect ourselves by contracts or getting into all kinds of due diligence or just we just forget about it. We can do fine over time dealing with people that we like and admire and trust. So we have never, and a lot of people do get the idea because the bad actor will tend to try and tantalize you in one way or another. And you won't win. It just pays to avoid them. We started out with that attitude and maybe one or two experiences have convinced us even more so that that's the way to play the game."
"What quantitative method would you suggest that investors use for expensing the option grants of publicly traded firms where there is no realistic prospect for the substitution of such an options program with a cash-based performance incentive plan? In other words, how do you derive the 5 to 10% earnings dilution referred to in this year's Brookshers annual report and is it possible that the dilution figure could be even higher than that?","And the question about how we charge for stock options is very simple. We look at what a company issues an option is over say a 5-year period and divide by 5s because the grants are irregular or whatever there's some reason why that seems inappropriate. We might use something else, but we try to figure out what the average option issue is going to be. And then we say to ourselves how much could the company have received for those options if they sold them as warrants to the public? I mean they can sell me options on any company in the world. I'll pay some price for an option on anything. And we would look at what the fair market value of those options would be that day if they were transferable options. Now they aren't transferable, but they also employ sometimes get their options reprised downward, which you don't get if you have public options. So we say that the cost to the shareholder of issuing the options is about what could be received if they sold Windows options into warrants and sold them public or sold them as options. And that's the cost. I mean it's a compensation cost and just try going to a company that's had a lot of options grants every year and tell them you're going to you're going to quit giving the options and pay people the same amount of money. They'll say you took away part of my earnings and we say if you've taken away part of the earnings then let's show it in the income account and show it as a cost because it is a cost. And I think actually a number of auditors agreed to that position many years ago and they started receiving pressure from their clients who said gee that you know that might hurt our earnings if we reported that cost. And the auditors caved and they put pressure on Congress when it came up a few years ago and I think it's a scandal but it's happened. We are going to in evaluating a business we're going whether we're going to buy the entire business or whether they're going to buy part of it. We're going to figure out how much it's costing us to issue and when the company issues those options every year and if they reprise them we're going to figure out how much that particular policy costs us and that is coming out of our pocket as investors and I think people are quite foolish if they ignore that. I don't think it's going to change. It's too much in corporate America's interest to keep it out of the income account and keep issuing more and more options percentage wise and not have it hit the income account and to reprise when stocks go down but that doesn't make it right. Charlie. I go sub-arzt to say it's fundamentally wrong not to have rational honest accounting and in big American corporations and it's very important not to let little corruptions start because they become big corruptions and then you have vested interests that fight to perpetuate them. Surely there are a lot of wonderful companies that issue stock options and stock options go a lot of wonderful employees that are really earning them but all that said the accounting in America is corrupt and it's not a good idea to have corrupt accounting. You can see the problem of the of the creep in it once it starts. It's much like campaigns when asked reform. I mean if you let it go for a long time the system becomes so embedded and the participants become so dependent upon it that there's a huge constituency that will fight like the very devil to prevent any change regardless of the logic of the situation. I mean once you get a significant number of important players benefiting from any kind of corruption and any kind of system you're going to have a terrible time changing it. That's why it should be changed early and it would have been easier to change the accounting for stock options some decades back when it was first proposed than now because basically corporate America is hooked on it. This does not mean that we are against options for say. Charlie and I died tonight and you had two new faces up here who didn't have the benefit of having bought a lot of Berkshire a long time ago and they had responsibility for the whole enterprise. It would not be inappropriate to pay them in some way that was reflective of the prosperity of the whole enterprise. I mean they would it would be crazy to pay the people of Derek Wiener options of Berkshire out the way or the people at Starfurniture or any one of our operations because they have responsibility for a given unit and what the price of Coca-Cola stock does could swamp their efforts in either direction. It just would be inappropriate but it would not be inappropriate to pay somebody that's got the responsibility for all of Berkshire. I mean I think it would be easier to pay the people of Berkshire in a way that reflected the prosperity of all of Berkshire and a properly designed option system which would be much different than the ones you see because it would be much more rational. Could well make sense for one or two people that had the responsibility for this whole place. Charlie and I aren't interested in that but I think that you may be looking at two people up here 50 years from now. I hope that that where it would it would be appropriate but any option system A should not involve giving an option at less than the place could be sold for today regardless of the market price because once management is in control it can make that decision and it should reflect the cost of capital and very very few systems reflect the cost of capital but if we're going to sit here and plow all the money back every year into the business and euro in effect use your earnings interest free to increase our own earnings in the future we think there has to be a cost of capital to have a properly properly designed option system people aren't interested in that the option consultants aren't interested in that because that isn't what their clientele wants. Charlie you probably wound up a little more now in this too. No I wound up enough."
"Berkshire owns several companies, stock and several companies which are called permanent holdings. In the early 70s we had a two tier market, the one decision stocks, high PEs, 50, 60 times earnings. If that were to reappear again, would Berkshire's companies still be permanent or is there a price for everything?","There are things that we think there are no price for and we've been tested sometimes and haven't sold them. My friend Bill Gates says that it has to be a logical at some point. At some price you have to be willing to sell something that's a marketable security for getting about a controlled business. I doubt if we ever get tested on, there's only a couple of them in that category. Actually I won't comment on that. We really have a great reluctance to sell businesses where we like both the business and the people. I don't think I'd count on seeing many sales. If you ever attend a meeting here and there are 60 or 70 times earnings, keep an eye on me. Charlie, the so-called two tier market created difficulties. I would say primarily because a lot of people, companies were called tier one when they really weren't. They just had been at some time at tier one. If you're right about the companies, you can hold them at pretty high values. You can really hold them at extraordinary levels if you've got it. It's too hard to find businesses that are as good. Then you have to say, am I going to get a chance to buy back the same business at a lot lower price or am I going to buy something that's almost as good at a lot lower price? We don't think we're very good at doing that. Actually, brother, just sitting and holding the business and pretending to stock market doesn't exist. That actually has worked out way better for us than I would have predicted 20 years ago. That mindset has, 25 years ago, that mindset has been a fair amount of good fortune that's flowed out of that that I really wouldn't have predicted. You're demonstrating your trick again. I was still learning. A lot of people regard that as cheating."
"You touched on the subject of return on equity in response to a different question. I wonder whether you might be willing to elaborate along the following line. Right now, the standard in 400 and aggregate have a return on equity of about 22%. The average over the decades for corporate America has been more like 12 or 13%. How did we get to this point of extraordinary profitability and how likely do you think we are over the next 10 or 15 years to revert back to the mean of the low teams?","Well, I would say is I never thought it would happen. So I start out with the fact that if you'd listen to me, you'd have been dead wrong in terms of what the return on equity in 1996 or 1995, 1997 would be. It does not seem to me that 22% returns on equity are sustainable in a world where long from interest rate to 7%. The capability of saving large amounts in the economy are quite dramatic. You would just think that there would be some sort of leveling effect between 7 and 22, you name, that as savings got directed within the economy and as the competitive forces operate that we've been taught, will operate over time would come into play. But I've been wrong on that subject then. That's why I say these levels are not unjustified if those kinds of returns can be made because let's just say that you had a 22% perpeturable bond and you had the ability and let's say that a quarter of that third of that coupon would be paid out. You got a bond with a 22% coupon and say 7% is paid out being the dividend pay out on the S&P will say. The other 15% is reinvested in more 22% bonds with similar characteristics. What's that instrument worth on a present value basis and a 7% for all that? A lot of money. In fact, it's worth so much money that becomes a mathematical fallacy at some point because when the compound rate becomes more than the discount rate, you get into infinite numbers which you're getting infinity. That's the concept we like to think about around Berkshire. I figured out how to obtain it. There's a book called The Peter's Bird Paradox. That is an article called The Peter's Bird Paradox and the Gross Stock fallacy. I think that's the name of it by following David Durand, written about 25 years ago. It gets into this bit where the growth rate is higher than the discount rate and it shouldn't work for an extended period of time. It sure is fine while it's going on. Charlie? Yeah. I think a couple of things contributed to this phenomenon that we so carefully misproductive. Number one, it became very fashionable for corporations to buy in shares. I think that we helped in a very small way bring on that enlightenment. I think that was a plus in terms of rational corporate decision making. The other thing that happened is that the anti-trust administration got way more lenient than allowing people to buy competitors. Raised returns on capital in the United States. That can't... I wouldn't think that could go on forever. But 15% for Anna compounded will do is grow way faster than the economy can grow way faster than I could get profits can grow over a long fall. So soon or later something has to happen. I don't think we've reached a new order of things where we'll also mathematics or somehow repeal. It's real output in this country grows at say 3% a year. Oh, real GDP grows at 3% a year. And the capitalized value of industry in the country grows at 10% a year. At some point you get into mathematical absurdities with the low inflation rates. You can't have a... We have an economy that's 7 or 8 trillion now in GDP and 7 or 8 trillion in equity valuation that may or may not make sense. But if you have one that's 15 billion in GDP and 75 billion in equity valuation, 75 trillion in equity valuation, you get the things that don't... You can't make any sense. So if you get these differential rates of growth among items that have some relationship, however tenuous or at least non-specific in the short run, it doesn't work after a while. And nobody wants to think about that. They don't want to think about their own death. But I mean, it doesn't go away just because you don't want to think about it. We haven't gotten any point like that. But you can project out numbers and they just won't make any sense after a while. Corporate profits can't be 200% of GDP. Yeah. And they can't be 50% of GDP. So these high rates of compounding just go automatically into absurdity. Yeah, they really can't be 20% of GDP or some number like that. And if you start saying you can't have a multiple of more, you get differential rates and they just simply... You leave the tracks after a while. All you people should be aware of this because all the people who are professional sellers of investment advice and brokerage service, et cetera, et cetera, have an immense best of interest in believing that things that can't be true are true. Yeah. And not only that, they've been selected in a Darwinian process to have formidable sales skills and large energy. And this is dangerous to the rest of us. Yeah. They've been selected to be the recipients of their advice. Furthermore, they figure out who we are."
"Some 30 years ago you disbanded your Buffett partnership saying that you felt out of step with the market and you feared a permanent loss of capital. Given today's market and current valuations, it birthed your halfway with a partnership of 100 partners instead of a corporation. Would you consider disbanding it as you did 30 years ago and if not, why not and was that the right decision back then?","Well, if our activities were limited to marketable securities and I had less than 100 partners and we were operating with this kind of money so that there was a real limitation on what we could do. I would simply tell the partners and let them make the decision. That would be easy enough. We're not in that position. A, we've got a number of wonderful businesses and those businesses will grow in value and in some cases very significantly in value. And it's not a feasible way. People have their own way if they decide that since we're unable to find things that they'd rather go on to something else. They have their own way of getting out and they can get out of that certainly a premium to the amount of money they put into the business over the years. So if I were running a marketable securities portfolio now and more limited to that, I would explain very carefully to my partners. How limited my ability to make money in this market would be and then I would ask them to do whatever they wish to do. Some of them might want to pull out and others might want to stay. In the 1969 period when I closed up, A, I had a similar situation in terms of finding things. And D, I really felt that the expectations of people that have been so raised by the experience we'd had over the previous 13 years that it may be very uncomfortable. And I felt unable to dampen those expectations. And I really just didn't find it comfortable to operate where my partners, even though they might nod their heads understandingly and say that we really know why you aren't making any money while everybody else is. I didn't think I wanted to face the internal pressure that would come from that. I don't feel any such internal pressure in running Burtshire. Charlie? Yeah, I think there are some similarities between 1969 and 1970. And the present time, but I don't think that means that 1973 for lies right ahead of us. We can't predict that. You can argue it worked out wonderfully for. Armed equipment. 69 and then have 73 for to come into with his powder dry. I don't think we're likely to be quite that fortunate again. Yeah, it was a long time from 69 notice 73. I mean, it sounds easy looking back, but but the nifty 50 as you may remember sort of it their peak in in 72. So although there was a sinking spell for a while in that 69 70 period, the market came back very strong, but you know that that's that's part of the game. I mean, it stayed cheap a long time in the 70 from the 73 period on and you will find waves of optimism and pessimism. And they'll never be exactly like they were before, but but they will come in some some form or other. We that is not mean we're sitting around with a bunch of cash because we expect stocks to go down though. We will we keep looking for things. We're looking for things right now. We're talking to people right now about about things that that where we could expense substantial sums of money, but it's much more difficult in this period."
I'm a question has to do with one of the major American industries unless I miss something in the reading. That is the pharmaceutical industry. Companies that make medicines. I don't wonder under what circumstances you might consider those industries for investment by Berkshire Hathaway.,"Well, those pharmaceutical industries have obviously been a terrific industry to invest in. We have trouble, at least I have trouble, distinguishing among the companies in terms of seeing which ones 10 years from now might be the best ones to be. It's easy for me to figure out that Coca-Cola is a soft drink company to be in or to let us the shaving company to be in or Disney is the entertainment company to be in. It is for me to figure out which one in the pharmaceutical. I'm not saying you can't do it. I'm just saying that that's difficult for me. We started buying one of them a couple of years ago and we should have continued but we didn't because it went up and eight. Your chairman was a little reluctant to follow a terrible mistake. I would say the biggest, and we could have bought the whole industry and done very well at various times, particularly when the threat of what people thought was the threat of the Clinton health program or cash to big cloud over the pharmaceutical industry. That was the time we could have just bought the whole industry and done very well. We didn't do it. It was a mistake. Charlie. Well, it's hard to think of any industry that's done more good for consumers generally. When you think of the way children used to die and now they very seldom die. It's been a fabulous business and it's been all the glories of American civilization. But we've admired it but we haven't been part of it. We've missed a lot of things. I'm dead serious about that and we missed things that should not have been beyond our capacity to grasp. There are a lot of things that should be beyond our capacity to grasp but there's something that haven't been. We've just been finestimated."
". For a 23-year-old with high ambitions, some initial working capital, and a genetic wiring, as you call it, for disciplines like investments, mathematics, and technology, what do you foresee as the significant areas of opportunity over the next 50, even 100 years? And if you were in my shoes, what would be your approach and methodology for really learning, tackling and mastering these areas of opportunity for the purpose of massive value creation?","Well, I'd remain very big on the idea of reading everything aside. And frankly, when you get the chance to talk to somebody like Laura Merdavidsson, as I did, when I was 20 years old, I probably learned more from Laura Merdavidsson in those four or five hours than I learned in college with the exception of learning some accounting or one or two subjects like that. So you just want to soak it up. If you have those qualities you talked about, you'll see the areas as you go along. I mean, we have Charlie and I probably, we've made money in a lot of different ways, some of which we didn't anticipate, you know, one we were 30 or 40 years ago, but we did have the ability to recognize some. We didn't have the ability to recognize others, but we didn't know what when we knew what we were doing and when we didn't. And we just kept looking. We had a curiosity about things. You would know at a time like the long-term capital management crisis, for example, that there were going to be ways to make money. I mean, there were going to be out there, and all you had to do was just read and think eight or 10 hours a day, and you were going to cover a lot of possibilities, probably a very high percentage of them good and some of them sensational. So you can't really lay it out ahead of time. You can't have a defined roadmap, but you can have a reservoir of thinking, looking at different kinds of businesses, looking at different kinds of securities, looking at markets in different places, and you will then spot a reasonable number of things that come along. You won't spot every one of them. We've messed all kinds of things. But the biggest thing, too, is to have something in the way you're programmed so that you don't ever do anything where you can lose a lot. I mean, that our best ideas have not been better than other people's best ideas, but we've never had a lot of things that pulled us way back. So we never went two steps forward and one step back. We probably went two steps forward and a fraction of a step back. But avoiding the catastrophes is a very important thing, and it will be important in the future. I mean, you will have your chance to participate in catastrophes, Charlie. Yeah, and of course, the place to look when you're young is in the inefficient markets. You shouldn't be trying to guess whether one drug company has a better drug pipeline than another. You want to go when you're young someplace that's very inefficient. And you shouldn't be trying to guess whether the stock market's going to go up or whether long-term bonds are going to change in yield. I mean, you don't have anything to going in that kind of a game. But you can have a lot going in games that very few people are playing and maybe whether even got their heads screwed on wrong in terms of how they're thinking about the subject. The RTC was a great example of a chance to make a lot of money. I mean, here was a seller of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of real estate where the people that were selling had had no economic interest in it were eager to wind up the thing. And they were selling it at a terrible time when the people who had been ventured someone in lending were no longer lending. The people who had been ventured someone in the equity end of real estate had gotten cleaned out. So you had a great background of environment and then you had you had an imbalance of intensity in terms of analyzing situations between the seller, which was the government, with a bunch of people who had no economic interest in it, and were probably eager to wind up the job. And buyers on the other side who were of the generally cautious type because the more ventured some time it had taken them as those out of action. So and there were huge amounts of property. So you get these opportunities and you'll get more. I mean, there won't be any scarcity of opportunities in your life, although there will be days when you feel that way."
"Berkshire seems to have an enormous long-term advantage in spite of its large size and high equity prices. The structure of the company's activities, non-collable capital, substantial free cash flow, and improving insurance fundamentals, permit Berkshire to capitalize on potential asset price declines and dislocations in financial markets. Well, most investors would not either have the money or the cool minds to buy. Am I on the right track here?","Well, I think in certain ways you're... I mean, we do have disadvantages too, but we have... We have some significant advantages in buying businesses over time. We would be the preferred purchaser, I think, for a reasonable number of private companies and public companies as well. And we... our checks clear. So we... we will always have the money. People know that when we make a deal, it will get done and it will get done as fast as anybody can do it. It won't be subject to any kind of second thoughts or financing difficulties. And we bought... as you know, we bought John's Manville because the other group had financing difficulties. People know they will get to run their businesses as they run them before if they care about that and a lot of people do. Others don't. We have an ownership structure that is probably more stable than any company, our size or anywhere near our size in the country. And that's attractive to people. And we are under no pressure to do anything dumb. If we do things dumb, it's because we do things dumb. But it's not because anybody's making us do it. So those are significant advantages. And the disadvantage, the biggest disadvantage we have is size. I mean, it is harder to double the market value of a hundred billion dollar company than a one billion dollar company using our... what we have in our arsenal. I hope it isn't going to go away. I mean, I hope we don't become a billion dollar company and enjoy all the benefits of those. And I hope, in fact, we have the agony of becoming a much larger company. So you are on the right track whether we can deliver or not. It's another question. But we go into combat every day armed with those advantages. Charlie? Yeah. This is not a hog heaven period for virtue. The investment game is getting more and more competitive. And I see no sign that that is going to change. But people will do stupid things in the future. There's no question. I mean, I will guarantee you sometime in the next 20 years that people will do some exceptionally stupid things in equity markets. And then the question is, you know, are we in a position to do something about that one that happens. But we do we continue to prefer to buy businesses. Oh, that's that's what we really enjoy. When Charlie mentioned hog heaven, I thought we ought to open the peanut brittle here. Which I recommend hard."
"This question is for you, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. Mr. Buffett, I followed your career since I first read about you in the first edition of Forbes 400 that came out in 82. Reading your profile also led me to been Graham's book the Intelligent Investor since that time I followed the careers of, I've also followed the careers of other successful investors such as Walter Slosh, Bill Roaine, Richard Rangwater, Robert Bass, Edward Lampert. In following your career in the careers of these other highly successful investors is my observation and my firm belief that despite their obvious high level of intelligence and some of them having gone to some of the best schools in the country, none of these people, including yourself, were born great investors. Every one of these, including yourself, learned to be a great investor. Graham learned from his experience, you, Bill Roaine, Walter Slosh, learned from Graham. Richard Rangwater learned from you, Phil Fisher and Charlie Allen, and from Reading Graham, Robert Bass and Edward Lampert, learned from Richard Rangwater and most likely from reading Graham and Fisher as well. These observations lead me to the conclusion that despite intellectual brilliance, although that probably helps, I've come to conclusion that great investors are made not born. Do you and Mr. Munger agree with this conclusion if so why, if not why not, and if you do agree, what things would you recommend that someone do if they wanted to become a great investor? Also, what mental attributes do you think a person should have if they want to try to become a great investor?","I largely agree with what you said. I would say that there, I don't know to what extent, in the ability to detach yourself from the crowd, for example. I don't know to what extent that's innate or to what extent that's learned, but that's a quality you need. I would agree totally with you that a great IQ is not needed. I mean, you do not have to be, terrifically smart, to do well as an investor at all. I would say you're 100% right that I learned from Graham first in a very, very big way, and I learned something additionally from Phil Fisher and I learned a lot from Charlie. The proof is in my record actually, from 11 to 19, I was reading Garfield Roo and Edwards and McGee and all kinds of, I mean I read every book, I regerald them low, I mean I read every book there was on investments and I didn't do well at all. I had no real investment philosophy, and a lot of things I tried. I was having a lot of fun, I wasn't making any money, and I read Ben's book in 1949 or 1949 when I was University of Nebraska, and that actually just changed my whole view of investing it. And really, it basically told me to think about a stock as a part of a business. Now that seems so obvious, you can say, you know, that that, why should you regard that as the Rosetta Stone, but it is a Rosetta Stone in a sense. Once you crank into your mental apparatus, that you're not looking at things that wiggle up and down on charts or that people send you little misses on, you know, saying buy this because it's going on next week or it's going to split or the dividends going to get increased or whatever. But instead you're buying a business that you now set a foundation for going on and thinking rationally about investing. And there's no reason why you need a high IQ to do that. There's no reason why you have to be born in some way. I do think there's certain manners of temperament that maybe in eight, they may be learned, they may be intensified by experiences you go on partially in eight, but then reinforced in various ways by your experiences you go through life. But that's enormously important. I mean, you have to be realistic. You have to just define your circle of competence accurately. You have to know what you don't know and not get enticed by it. You can't be, you have to have an interest in money. I think you won't be good and investing, but I think if you're very greedy, it'll be a disaster because that will overcome rationality. But I think the same books I read and really molded how I thought about businesses and investing. I think that they're just as valid now. I mean, I haven't seen anything in the last 25 years and I read my, I clanced through most of the books anyway. I've seen nothing to improve on Graham and Fisher in terms of the basic approach of going about investing, which is to is to think about stocks as businesses and then think about what makes a good business. And really, that's all there is to do investing and having a margin of safety, which Ben talks about and so on. It's not a complicated process, but it definitely requires a discipline. It requires, requires insulating yourself from popular opinion. You just simply cannot, you can't pay any attention to it. It just doesn't mean anything. So you can't, the idea of listening to lots of people tell you things and all that. It's just a waste of time. You know, you'd be better off just sitting and thinking a little better. I mean, there were, there were no analyst reports on custom frame makers, you know, it just doesn't. And they wouldn't have been any good anyway. You just have to think, but you have to think about them as in terms of their business characteristics and what they can earn on the on Capitol employed and that sort of thing. I would just read the, you know, I would, I would read the Graham and the Phil Fisher books and, and then read lots of annual reports, think about businesses and try and think about which businesses you understand, and which you don't understand. And you don't have to understand them all. Just forget about the ones that you don't understand. Drawing. Yeah, at a deeper level of generality. If you have a passionate interest in, in knowing why things are happening, you always are trying to figure out the world in terms of why is this happening or why is this not happening. That cast of mind kept over long periods. Gradually improves your ability to cope with reality. And if you don't have that cast of mind, I think you're, you're destined to probably for failure, even if you've got a pretty high IQ. I would say we've seen relatively little correlation between investment results and IQ. I mean, not that there are a whole bunch of people out there with 80 IQs that are knocking, you know, the cover off the ball, but, but there are all kinds of people with high IQs that get no place. And yet it's probably in a sense it's more interesting to look at why people with high IQs don't succeed and then sort of cast out those factors and see if you can cast them out in yourself and leave a residual that will work. Because if you, you know, it's like Charlie always says, you know, all I want to know is where I'm going to die. So I'll never go there. If you studied the people who die financially, you know, with high IQs and say, why do they die? You know, you'll see certain overwhelming characteristics that are present and most of the cases. And you just got to make sure that either you don't possess them or if you do possess them that you can get rid of them or control them in some manner."
Are you concerned about the rising valuations on the NASDAQ market where companies trade at multiples of revenues instead of multiples of earnings?,"Oh. Where they traded 10 times revenues. We're more, 30 times revenues instead of 10 times earnings. Yeah. Well, we don't pay much attention to that because throughout the career, Charlotte, I've had an investing, there have always been hundreds of cases or thousands of cases of things that are ridiculously priced and phony stock promotions and the goalable being led into to believe in things that just can't come true. So that that's always going on and always will go on and it doesn't make any difference to us. I mean, we are not trying to predict markets. We never will try and predict markets. We're trying to find wonderful businesses and the fact that a part of the market is kind of screwy, you know, that's that's that's that's unimportant to us. We we tried a few times shorting some of those things in our in our innocence of youth and the very tough to make money shorting even the obvious frauds and there are some obvious frauds. It really is it's not tough to it's not so tough to find the obvious frauds and it's not tough to be right over 10 years but it's it's it's it's very tough to make money being short them although we tried a few times way back. It's it's we don't look at indicia from from stocks in general or from PEs or price sales ratios or what other things are doing. We really just focus on businesses. We don't we don't care if there's a stock market. I mean, would we want to own Coca-Cola? The 8% we own a Coca-Cola 11% of Gillette. If they if they said they you know we're just going to de-list the stock and we're never going to you know we'll open it again in 20 years. It's fine with us you know and then if it goes down on the news we'll pie more of it. So we care about what the business does."
"My question has to do with estimating the intrinsic value of a company, in particular the capital-intensive companies like you were mentioning. I'm thinking of things like McDonald's and Walgreens, but there are lots of others where you have a very healthy and growing operating cash flow, but it's smartly or completely offset by heavy expenditures on putting up new stores or restaurants or building a new plant. My question is, what do you do for your estimate of future free cash flow? And with the long treasury is around 6% at what rate do you discount those cash flows?","Well, we discount at the long rate just to have a standard measurement across all businesses, but we would take the company that is spending the money as it comes in and they don't get credit for gross cash flow. They get credit for whatever net cash is left every year, but of course if they're spending the money wisely, even though you have to discount it for more years, the growth in cash development should offset that or they weren't investing wisely. The best business is one that gives you more and more money every year without putting up anything to get it or very little. And we've got some businesses like that. The second best business is a business that also gives you more and more money. It takes more money, but the rate at which you invest, reinvest the money to get that growth is a very satisfactory rate. The worst business of all is the one that grows a lot and where you're forced in effect, forced to grow to stay in the game at all and where you're reinvesting the capital at a very low rate of return. Sometimes people run those businesses without knowing about it. But in terms of discounting, in terms of calculating intrinsic value, you look at the cash that is expected to be generated and you discount back, in our case we use the long-term treasury rate. That doesn't pay me, that you pay the amount that that present value of calculation leads to, but it means that you use that as a common yardstick that's treasury rate. And that means if somebody is reinvesting all their cash for the next five years, they better have some very big figures coming in down the road because it's some day, financial asset, that has to give you back cash to justify you laying out cash for now for it now. Investing is the art essentially laying out cash now to get a whole lot more cash later on and something at some point that are delivered cash. Ben Graham in his class used to be just to talk about what he called the frozen corporation. And the frozen corporation was the company who's charter prohibited it from ever paying anything to its owners or everything, liquid-entitor or ever being sold and sort of like Hollywood producer. Yeah. And the question was what was such an enterprise work? Well that's sort of a theoretical question, but of course you should think about the realities of what business is all about and business is all about putting out money today to get back more money later on. Okay. I do think there is an interesting problem that you raised because I think there is a class of businesses where the eventual cash back part of the equation tends to be an illusion. I think there are businesses where you just keep pouring it in and pouring it in and then all of a sudden it doesn't work and no cash comes back. And what makes our life interesting is trying to avoid those and get them the alternative kind that grounds you in cash. The one figure we regard as utter non-stances, the so-called EBITDA or I mean the idea of looking at a figure before the cash requirements are merely staying in the same place and there usually are any business with significant fixed assets almost always as with a concomitant requirement that major cash be reinvested in order simply to stay in the same place competitively and in terms of unit sales. To look at some figure that is before stated before those cash requirements is absolute folly and it's been misused by lots of people who saw lots of merchandise in recent years. It's not the credit of the investment banking fraternity but it just learned to speak in terms of EBITDA. The idea of using a measure that you know is nonsense and then piling additional reasoning on that false assumption. It's not credible intellectual performance. And then once everybody is talking in terms of nonsense why it gets to be standard."
When you hire a manager or evaluating the management team of a business you're thinking about buying what are the qualities you look for and Some of your managers were entrepreneurs who started their businesses from scratch when their business models were unproven and Some of them took over businesses that were already performing well when they took charge What are the qualities of a great entrepreneur that might be different from those of a manager who can be great at running a company That's established but that may not be able to start a business from scratch and think around with a business model and figure out how to make it successful,
"Yeah, well, we love managers that have a passion for their business and when we're buying a business we have to ask ourselves They love the money or do they love the business if they love the money? There's nothing wrong with that but they probably wouldn't be running the business for us a year or two down the road I think one difference is that people that create their own businesses The entrepreneurs probably on average would have a significantly greater degree of passion for those businesses than somebody that was just brought in a few years ago And sees themselves as making a profit in the fears on reselling the business of leaving I you'll you'll find exceptions in both camps but We've had terrific luck with the entrepreneurs I'm basically love their businesses the way I love Berkshire. I mean they they are not gonna let anything happen to their businesses They can you know, they'll tell me to butt out if I'm gonna screw up something in the in their operations and and they they don't regard them I mean in a certain sense I mean they know they're part of Berkshire, but but they regard them In a certain jealousy almost as being their businesses and we love it that way and You know, we can we can spot it when we see it and when we also can avoid it We have never I just got one in the other day some from an investment banker on a on somebody that wants to resell a business They bought a few years ago. Well, you know the chances that they haven't Doctored up the figures in some way or trying to sell I mean it you know there It's a piece of meat to them and if it's a piece of meat to them, you know, what am I gonna do with it? So we If we make the proper judgment About the passion they have for their business They're gonna keep running they may have a lot of money in the bank, but they're gonna keep running the businesses force because they love those businesses And they they really are motivated the same way I am I you know, it would them make any difference what I get paid You know, I I'm identified in my own mind With how Berkshire does not really don't care how the rest of the world thinks about how Berkshire's doing I mean in other words and When we look like we were out of step a few years ago that really doesn't make any difference to me as long as I feel okay about how Berkshire's doing But I do you know, that's how I measure what I'm doing every day Not by the price of the stock but by what's going on in the business and that's what we have a group of managers like that and they're I don't think there's what there can't be a company in the country in my view That if you could figure out some way to measure the passion involved In terms of running their business. I don't think there's anybody that could come close to matching the It's a quantity that we have managed to marshal together At Berkshire it's been accidentally over time, but it's it's it's really almost unique. I think it is unique Charlie Well, it's very interesting to think about what matters most the passion or the competence that was born in Certainly Berkshire's full of people who have a peculiar amount of passion in their Love for their own business and I Would argue that probably the passion is more important than the brain power Yeah, by the time they get to us If they were passionate that incompetent they don't get to us. I mean we you know They're not going to be there unless they're competent But the question is whether they had a passion for money or a passion for their business to some degree and Like it they all like money. I mean and and and and the reason and they like it partly because it enables them to build the business they love but They don't we're not going to see an incompetent but passionate manager by the time we start laying out a lot of money for a business They got weeded out a long time ago. So I don't have to weed those out, but I do have to weed out the ones who Want to cash a big paycheck and go off and do something else at some time and like I say we've had Great luck at that that but we have literally I Mean we see lots and lots of businesses owned by usually owned by financial operator types where it's absolutely clear that you know they they have come in they've rubbed it up they played games with the accounting they That is about run out, you know and they want to sell it and it and interestingly enough some fairly often those are built by bought by other financial operators who think they're going to play the game a second time We are not interested in any of those at all",
"And my question is, what criteria do you use to sell stock? I kind of understand how you buy it. I'm not sure how you sell.","Well, the best thing to do is buy a stock that you don't ever want to sell. I mean, that's what we're trying to do. And that's true when we buy an entire business. I mean, we've bought all of Geico, or we've bought all of C's, CAND, you had a buffalo nose. We're not buying those to resell. I mean, what we're trying to do is buy a business that we will be happy with if we own it the rest of our lives and we expect to do with those. It's the same principle applies to marketable securities. You get extra options with marketable securities. You can add to holdings obviously easier. We can never own more than 100% of a business. But if we own 2% of a business and we like it at a given price, we can add and have 4 or 5%. So that's in advantage. Sometimes if we need money to move to another sector like we did last year, we will trim from some holdings. But that doesn't mean we're negative on those businesses at all. I mean, we think they're wonderful businesses or we wouldn't own them. And we would sell, A, if we needed money for other things. The Geico stock that I bought in 1951, I sold in 1952. It was in a one-on-to-the-worth 100 or more times before the 1976 problems. 100 or more times what I paid. But I didn't have the money to do something else. So you sell if you need money for something else, you may sell if you believe that valuations between different kinds of markets are somewhat out of whack. And we have done a little trimming last year in that matter. That could well be a mistake. I mean, the real thing to do with the great business is just hang on for dear life. Charlie? Yes, but the sales that do happen, the ideal is when you found something you'd like immensely better. Isn't that obvious? That's the ideal way to sell. And is it really the ideal purchase is to find, is to have something that you already like, be selling an apprised where you feel like my more of it. I mean, we probably should have done more of that in the past in some situation. But that's the beauty of marketable securities. You really do, if you're in a wonderful business, you do get a chance periodically maybe to double up in it or something to sort. If the market, stock market would sell a lot cheaper than it is now, we would probably be buying more of the businesses that we already own. And they would certainly be the first ones that we would think about there. They're the businesses we like the best."
"I've been a shareholder for four years. This is my first visit to Omaha. I went to the Megamart and I actually bought something there and I tried to pay for it with American Express Card and they told me just like the ad, you can't use it here. I hope you both comment on that or at least one of you. But my real question is that I just stumbled across the idea of intellectual capital and how that might be useful in valuing a business. And I was hoping that one or both of you could clarify that for me and whether that's useful to us as investors or just another academic theory that we could be better off ignoring.","Yeah. Harvey Gala, who runs American Express and has done a terrific job over on here, has written me about the furniture market as well as about Cs. And we basically let our managers run their own businesses. So the people at each entity, Borshribe's takes American Express, others of our businesses do too. We let every manager make its decisions. As soon as I start telling the managers that they ought to say take American Express or not take Visa or whatever it may be, at that point they've lost some of the responsibility for their operations. And perhaps to an extent even some of the pride that comes from running them, most of our managers do not need to work for a living. They run their businesses for the same reason, Charles and I run Borshribe. They love doing it. They jump out of bed in the morning. This is exciting to do. And the one thing that would keep the two of us or drive the two of us away from Borshribe is if we were getting second guest all the time or somebody else was telling us when to swing or not to swing. We would have no interest in running it. We go run, we do something else then. And maybe our other managers aren't as extreme as we are in that respect. We feel they've built successful businesses, they know how to do it. We do allocate the excess capital they generate. But aside from that we really let them make their own decisions. So we have no company-wide policy, un-Bertchley anything that I can think of except send money to Omaha. But, and we're delighted to have American Express give the furniture mark the reasons why furniture mark will be better off using American Express. And my guess is they have some very good reasons. But they're going to have to sell them on that. And just like any vendor of anything that has to sell each operating. We wouldn't tell the people at C's who to buy these, the nuts from or who to buy the container from or anything of the sort, how to design the stores or whatever it may be. And that's just the Berkshire philosophy on that. Charlie, you want to come in? Yeah, let me shift to the intellectual capital. Berkshire has a lot of intellectual capital and he's very able executives in the various businesses. And we hope we've got some intellectual capital in the few hundred square feet at headquarters. But we are not in the business of designing oil refineries with armies of engineers or developing software with armies doing complicated accounting work all over the world. We just haven't drifted into that kind of a business. And intellectual capital has gotten to be a new buzzword because we've not developed huge businesses like Microsoft, which really didn't exist on that scale not so very long ago. And so people suddenly realize, my God, there's really a lot of money and an aggregation effects and momentum effects when you get a bunch of really bright people working in the same direction. But that's what's made the concept so fashionable. But in large, we've avoided the field. Again, it's hard for us to understand. Yeah, we've looked for brains and energy and integrity in people that we work with. And if you get that combination in your indecent business, you know, you're going to own the world. And whether you call it an intellectual capital or anything, you know, you can stick the names on. And that's who we try to associate with. I mean, it's a lot easier than doing it yourself. And when we get in our own businesses, you saw that group there at the end of the movie. I mean, that's a huge asset to Berkshire. They talk about getting into accounting for it with that's nonsense in my view. I mean, you don't need to do that. But you, you, you should pay for it. And you should pay for it as shareholders. You should pay for it as managers. When we get people, you know, whether it's Tom Murphy or Alzen at your letter, Roberto Goi's letter or Michael Eisner, I mean, those people added billions of dollars of value. And it's just, you know, that's who we want to be associated with. And we don't want to be associated with the mediocre managers because the difference is just huge. But we don't go through an elaborate exercise. We just recognize the people that got those, we think we, we try to recognize the people that got those qualities. And then we, and then if they're in a good business and they've got those qualities, we want to take a big bite. But take the intellectual capital, people think patents, they think copyrights, patents and copyrights have gotten to be way more valuable as a percentage of the investment assets of the world. And so people are very much more interested in intellectual capital. So, think of the great drug companies and how small they were 20 years ago and how everything they have is basically intellectual capital. It's the few products that have really worked that have the patents. But in large we're not in drug companies. No, but that's it. There are different forms. There's Charlie said, there's businesses that you sort of think of that way as their whole being being intellectual capital, but I would argue that when Roberto voice, what a 15 years ago saw how to make the future of Coke, same product, dramatic and basically the same system all that requires some changes. But saw how to make that dramatically more valuable by doing a lot of little things over a long period of time and doing them consistently and not getting as high as they've all Michael Lyser did the same thing that Disney hadn't gone any place. In the 15 years or so after Walt died. Now we all know Mickey Mouse wasn't everything, but Michael really saw what the future should be. And he still does. And you say it's easy when it's all over, but how many people were doing something about at the time? It was languishing, basically, 15 years ago to have the assets. To me, it's different than what Bill Gates does or Andy Grove does, but it's our form of intellectual capital. It's one we can understand better."
"The financial community relies heavily on the PE ratio when evaluating prospective investments. When you buy a company, you will certainly consider not just the future stream of earnings, but also the company's financial condition among other things. My financial condition is speaking mainly of cash and debt, but the PE doesn't take into consideration either cash or debt. Occasionally, you see a company with consistently positive free cash flow trading just over cash value, effectively giving away the future earnings. In cases like this, the PE looks terribly overstated unless adjusted for cash and debt. I've always preferred companies with uddles of cash to those burdened with lots of debt. And then I read Phil Fisher's book Conservative Investors Sleep Well. Well, I haven't slept well since. He really confused me when he commented that hoarding cash was evil. He wrote that instead of debt companies should either put the cash to good use or distribute it to shareholders. Can I get your thoughts on this?","Well, there are times when we're a wash and cash, and there have been plenty of times when we didn't have enough cash. Charlie and I remember in the late 60s, when bank credit was very difficult, we were looking for money over in the Middle East. Do you remember that Charlie? Yeah, thank you. Yeah. And they wanted us to repay it in dinars. Yeah. And the guy that wanted us to repay him and diners or diners or what they'll call them was also the guy that determined the value of those things. So we were not terribly excited about them on payday and having him decide the exchange rate on that date. But we obviously are looking every day for ways to deploy cash. And we would never have cash around just to have cash. I mean, we would never think that we should have a cash position of X percent. And frankly, I think these asset allocation things that that tacticians in Wall Street put out, you know, about 60% stocks and 30, we think that's total nonsense. So we want to have all our money working in decent businesses, but sometimes we can't find them or sometimes cash comes unexpectedly or sometimes we sell something. And we have more cash around than we would like. And more cash around than we would like means that we have 10 or 15 cents around because we want money employed, but we'll never employ it, just employ it. And in recent years, we've tended to be cash heavy, but not because we want to cash per se. In the mid-70s, you know, we were scraping around for every dime we could find to buy things. We don't like lots of leverage and we never will. We'll never borrow lots of money at Berkshire. It's just not our style, but you will find us quite unhappy over time if cash just keeps building up. And I think one way or another we'll find ways to use it."
"My question, two-part question is concerning debt. We know that individual debt can be devastating. Do you, are you concerned that the American consumer is so far in debt as a whole, as to be a problem? And part two is, do you feel that our trade deficit with other countries is concerned to you?","Well, the first question about debt, I think it's very hard to answer about the consumer as a whole. I get letters every day from people who have problems in life and they're either health or debt and usually the frequently the debt is connected with health. But it's been very easy for them to borrow money and they're in over their heads and it's all over then. There's no question that the American consumer is somewhat more indebted and aggregate. But it's a very hard thing, I think, to come into conclusions about whether it poses a serious problem. Most people have had assets directly or indirectly that have gained in value enormously, particularly in real estate and some in security. So there's a greater capacity to carry debt as earning power increases and assets held increases. I can't give you a useful answer in terms of the world as a whole, but I constantly give advice to young people. And those are the only people I talk to aside from our shareholder group. But just don't start out behind the aidball. I mean, it's crazy to get in debt because it's so hard to get out of debt. The idea of having credit card debt and we issue credit cards in all our businesses, and so does every other retailer. But the idea of trying to borrow money at 18% and thinking you're going to get in a head in life, it isn't going to work. And I urge people to use their credit card, but I urge them to pay it off before it starts revolving because it's too expensive. Charlie and I can't make money with 18% money. We're looking around for float because we don't want to pay 5% for money. And so I'm very sympathetic to people get in debt. But once you get in it, it is hell to get out. Charlie will have a few Ben Franklinisms to quote on that subject. In fact, you want to give a few from Ben now? He'd love you, but I let it amend it the wrong way."
"You mentioned earlier that Berkshire's shoe business was great, but that other shoe businesses were not so good. What are the uncertainties of the global brand leaders that Berkshire seems to like? They like Coke and Gillette, the global brand leaders in the shoe business being Nike and Reebok. What are their uncertainties in terms of long-term competitive advantage, business economics, consumer behavior, and the other risk factors that you mentioned in the annual report this year.","So you really asked me about the future prospects of Nike and Reebok? Yeah, I don't know that much about those businesses. We do have one person in this audience at least who owns a lot of Reebok, but I'm not expressing a negative view in any way on that. I don't understand that they don't understand their competitive position and the likelihood of permanence of their competitive position over a 10 or 20 year period, as well as I think I understand the position of Brown and Dexter. That doesn't mean I think that it's inferior, doesn't mean that we've got better businesses or anything. I think we've got very good businesses, but I haven't done the work and I'm not sure if I did the work I would understand them. I think they are harder to understand, frankly, and to develop a fix on than our kinds, but they may be easier for other people who just have a better insight into that kind of business. Some businesses are a lot easier to understand than others. Charlie and I like difficult problems. If something is hard to figure, we'd rather multiply by three than by pi. It's just easier for us. Charlie, I mean... Well that is such an obvious point, and yet so many people think if they just hire somebody with the appropriate labels, they can do something very difficult. That is one of the most dangerous ideas a human being can have. All kinds of things just intrinsically create problems. The other day I was dealing with a problem and I said this thing, it's a new building. I said this thing has three things I've learned to fear. An architect, a contractor, and a hill. If you go at life like that, I think you at least make fewer mistakes than people who think they can do anything by just hiring somebody with a label. You don't have to hire out your thinking if you keep it simple. You don't have to do... We've said this before but you don't have to do exceptional things to get exceptional results. Some people think that if you jump over a seven foot bar, that the ribbon they pin on you is going to be worth more money than if you step over a one foot bar. It just isn't true in the investment world at all. You can do very ordinary things. What is complicated about this? We're three billion dollars pre-tax better off than we were a few years ago because of it. Nothing that I know about that product or its distribution system, its finances, or anything that really hundreds of thousands or millions of people aren't capable of. They don't already know. They just don't do anything about it. Similarly, if you get into some complicated business, you can get a report that's a thousand pages of theft and you've got PhDs working on it but it doesn't mean anything. You know, which you've got as a report but you won't understand that business what it's going to look like in ten or fifteen years. The big thing to do is avoid being wrong. There's some things that are so intrinsically dangerous. Another of my heroes is Mark Twain who looked at the promoters of his day and he said, a mine is a hole in the ground owned by a liar. That's the way I've come to look at projections. Basically, I can remember one of my were offered two million dollars worth of projections once and of course a buying a business and the book was this thick and for nothing and we were giving it for nothing and it wouldn't open it. You know, we'd almost pay two million not to look at it. It's ridiculous. I do not understand why any buyer of a business looks at a bunch of projections put together by a seller or as agent. You can almost say that it's naïve. To think that that has any utility whatsoever. We just are not interested. If we don't have some idea ourselves of what we think the future is to sit there and listen to some other guy who's trying to sell us the business or get a commission on it, tell us what the future is going to be. Like I say, it's very naïve. Yeah, and five years out. We had a line in the report one time, don't ask the barber whether he need a haircut and it's quite applicable to projections by sellers or businesses."
"if someone likes to form a company doing what you did 30 or 40 years ago, what is your suggestion to them? And would you share some of your wisdom with us?","First thing we'd suggest, they sent us a royalty. Charlie, you take over on that. You've thought more about starting over again than I have. I want to frankly say that that's a question I ordinarily duck. I always believe in getting the fundamental mental tools in place. I always believe in running reality as it comes in, preferably vicariously through the newspaper, et cetera, instead of through personal painful experience, through the filter of these sound ideas. And I not only think that that works in life to create success, I think it makes life more fun. So I argue for sound thinking, but the exact specific techniques of turning yourself into another war in Bovitt. I leave to you. Well, the one thing I would advise is I would be, I think there's a ton of opportunity out there. I would do something I enjoy. I wouldn't do something because I thought it was going to get me to a life I was going to enjoy later on, because if I made a lot of money, I was going to be a lot happier. I've never done that. I think that you will do well in what you enjoy. I think it's crazy in life to endure a whole lot. Charlie and I worked in the grocery store. We didn't really jump up and down over all the time. But in terms of making a commitment to really being a business that only you're only in it for the money, I think that's crazy. If we were in this for the money, we'd have quit a long time ago, obviously. You ought to have fun while you're doing it. It should not be jammed tomorrow and not jammed today. It should make any sense to me. I think you'll get better results then,"
"through various questions and comments we've mentioned the fact that the word trust which Berkshire Hathaway and the brand has, we've mentioned basically health and the importance of health and that being above everything else, with Berkshire's competencies in the insurance industry and with the healthcare services sector being relatively depressed, is although the dynamics would be different in the industry, how risk is managed on an overall basis, has Berkshire looked at all in terms of taking a position or buying a health insurance business?","Charlie runs a hospital, so I'm going to let him talk about this. Sure, we've looked a little, we looked at everything in turmoil, it's important in the world, but so far it hasn't seen the yield or particular mental approach. I don't know who I would want to get in with in that business at the moment, but that's not condemning the people in the business, it just means I don't know. I haven't been able to evaluate that and I think it would make an enormous difference in terms of wanting to get in with a quality operation and quality people and at a sensible price. And we haven't seen that, but that doesn't mean we can't just all feel either. There is a significant percentage of slok operators in the field who are painting the reality different than it is. That makes it harder."
"I have a question about the financial characteristics of the businesses that you like to acquire and invest in in your reports and other writings, Mr. Buffett, you state that you like to acquire businesses that can employ a large amount of capital to high returns. In reading the writings and speeches of yourself, Mr. Munger, I've seen you say in an outstanding investor digest and other publications that you enjoy investing in companies that require very little capital. I was wondering if these statements are at odds or if they are two sides of the same coin and if you could elaborate using Berkshire companies that would be great. Sure","It's a good question. The ideal business is one that earns very high returns on capital and could keep using lots of capital at those high returns. That becomes a compounding machine. If you have your choice, you could put $100 million into a business that earns 20% on that capital, say $20 million. Ideally, it would be able to earn 20% on $120 million the following year and $144 million the following year and so on. You could keep redeploying capital at these same returns over time, but there are very, very, very few businesses like that. The really, unfortunately, the good businesses, you know, take a Coca-Cola or C's candy, they don't require much capital. And incremental capital doesn't produce anything like the returns that this fundamental return that's produced by some great intangible. So we would love the business that earn that could keep deploying. In fact, even well beyond the earnings. I mean, we'd love to have a business that could earn 20% on $100 million now. And if we put a billion more in it, it would earn 20% more on that billion. But like I say, those businesses are so rare. There are a lot of promises of those businesses, but we've practically never seen one. There have been a few. Most of the great businesses generate lots of money. They do not generate lots of opportunities to earn high returns on incremental capital. You know, we can deploy X at C's and earn a lot of money. But if we put, if we put five X in, we don't earn any more money to speak of. We can earn high returns on X at the Buffalo news, but if we tried to make it five X, we don't earn any more money. They just don't have the opportunities to use incremental capital. We look for them, but, but they don't. So the great you've seen. I mean, we will talk theoretically about the businesses that are more and more money with with incremental capital at high returns. But what you've seen is that we bought businesses largely that earn good returns on capital, but in many cases have limited opportunities to earn anything like the returns they earn on their basic business with incremental capital. The one good thing about our structure at Berkshire is that we can take those businesses that earn good returns in their business, but don't have the opportunity for for returns of a similar magnitude on incremental money. And we can rule that money around to buy more businesses. Normally, if you're in the, take the newspaper publishing business, which has been a fantastic business over the years, you earned terrific returns on your own invested capital. But if you went out to buy other newspapers, you had to pay a very fancy price. And you didn't get great returns on incremental capital. But the people in that business felt that the only thing they knew was newspaper publishing or media of one sort or another. People, they felt that their options were limited. We can move money any place that it makes sense. And that's an advantage of our structure now, whether we do a good job, but it's not another question. But the structure is enormously advantageous in that respect. We can take the good business, the seized candy, seized as produced probably a billion dollars pre tax force since Charlie, and I wouldn't have gone up 100,000, you know, back in 1972. We tried to employ that in a candy business. We'd have gotten terrible returns over time. We wouldn't have gotten anything to speak up. But because we moved it around and enabled us to buy some other businesses over time. And that's, that's an advantage of our structure. Charlie. Yeah. And if you take a business that is a good business, but not a fabulous business, they tend to fall into two categories. One is the business where the whole reported profit just sits there and surplus cash at the end of the year. And you can take it out of the business and the business will do just as well without it as it would if it stayed in the business. The second business is one that reports the 12% on capital, but there's never any cash. It reminds me of the used construction equipment business of my old friend John Anderson. And he used to say, in my business every year, you make a profit. And there it is sitting in the yard. And there are a lot of businesses like that were just to keep going to stay in place. There's never any cash. Now that business doesn't enable headquarters to drag out all the cash and best it else work. We hate that kind of a business. Don't you think that's a fair statement? We like to be able to move cash around and and and haven't find its best use. And but that, you know, that's our job. And sometimes we find good uses. It would be it would be terrific. If every one of our great businesses and we've got a lot of great businesses had ways to deploy additional capital at great rates. But we don't see it. And frankly, you know, it doesn't happen. I mean, the Gillette has a great razor and blade business. I mean, fabulous. There's no way they can deploy the money they make in the razor and blade business to keep putting more money in that kind of business. It just doesn't take that kind of capital. They have to deploy some money. But it's it's peanuts compared to the profits. And the temptation then is to go out and buy other businesses. And of course, that's what Charlie and I do when we face that. But but we don't think that overall the batting average of American industry and redeploying capital has been great. Nevertheless, it's what we can try and do every day. In a sense, we sort of knock the very procedure that has gotten us to where we are. Is that a fair statement, Charlie? Absolutely. And that is always worried me. I don't like being an example of an activity where most people who try and follow up will get terrible results. And we try and avoid that by making these negative comments."
My question is an allocation of capital one. You've indicated that one thing you like in companies is a willingness on the part of management to repurchase its own shares. I wonder if you would talk for a minute about your own frame of reference on repurchases when it appears that the current price of the stock is rich in relation to its intrinsic value. Some have said that with the right company ongoing repurchases of stock should be made irrespective of the price. So would you speak for a moment as to how you think it pencils out when the current price of the stock is rich in relation to its intrinsic value?,"If you're repurchasing shares above a rationally calculated intrinsic value, you are harming your shareholders. Just as if you issue shares beneath that figure you are harming your shareholders. That's a truism. Now the tough part of that, of course, is coming up with the intrinsic value. For example, a good example might be Coca-Cola. I think a number of people might have thought Coca-Cola was repurchasing shares at a very high price because they'll look at book value or PE ratios. But there's a lot more to intrinsic value than book value and PE ratios. Any time anybody gives you some simplified formula for figuring it out, forget it. You have to understand the business. People who understood that business well, the management, have understood and been very forthright about saying so. Over the years, that by repurchasing their shares, they are adding to the value per share for remaining shareholders. And like I say, people who didn't understand Coca-Cola or who thought mechanistic methods of valuation could take precedence really misjudged the value to the Coca-Cola company of those repurchases. We favor, when you have a wonderful business, we favor using funds that are generated at that business to make the business even more wonderful. And we favor repurchasing shares if those shares are below intrinsic value. And I would say that if it's a really wonderful business, we probably come up with higher intrinsic values than most people do. We have great respect, Charlie, and I think it's developed over the years. We have enormous respect for the power of a really outstanding business. And we recognize how scarce they are. And if a management wishes to further intensify our ownership by repurchasing shares, we applaud. We just went over 8% of the Coca-Cola company, probably in the last three or so months, by a very tiny fraction. But we had a second purchase one time. But our percentage interest in the Coca-Cola company has gone up significantly through their repurchases. And we are better off because they bought those shares at what looked like to some people, perhaps, high prices. And we thought they were wrong at the time, and I think now it's been indicated or proven. So I urge you, if you're trying to decide on the wisdom of repurchases or of share issuances, that you don't think in terms of book value, you don't think in terms of specific PEs, you don't think in terms of any little model. But do you think in terms of what would you really, and eight, pick businesses you can understand, and then think what you really would pay to be in those businesses? That's what counts over time is whether the repurchases are made at a discount from that figure. And I would say with the companies that we own shares, and our interest in Geico went from 33% to 50% over a 15-year-old period, simply through repurchases. And we benefited significantly. So did every other shareholder I might add, that's the same with the company. We benefited in no way disproportionate to them. But that was a very wise action on their part. And there too, they were all usually buying that stock at least at book value. And you could compare it to other insurance stocks and say, well, that's too much to pay. But Geico wasn't an insurance company. It was comparable to other insurance companies. It was a very different sort of business. And they were very wise, in my view, to be following that course of action."
"You mentioned earlier, Rip, about the power of the brands on the internet. And I really can't think of a better brand, at least in my name, as the Berkshire Hathaway brand. And I guess going forward, have you thought about ways to use the Berkshire Hathaway name further on the internet to capitalize on the reputation you've built over the past decades?","Yeah, I think that's a very good point. And it's something that could be a real value. It's already probably of some value to us with the brands that we're associated with. I mean, I do think that that executive jetter, the netgev's program associated with Berkshire Hathaway, that foreshimes associated with Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire Hathaway life associated with Berkshire Hathaway, I think those brands are enhanced by the association with Berkshire as some of what other brands would be. But I think that's got a long way to go. I think you're dead right on that, that the internet reinforces the necessity for trust and dealing with people. I mean, you're getting further and further removed from the face-to-face dealing where you can go back to the store the next day or look at the person who sold it to you the next day and get an adjustment or something of the sort. You're really having to place more and more trust in somebody you're never going to see. And I think you're right that Berkshire Hathaway, the behaves itself properly, can get a reputation for trust that will be far greater than that possessed by the average company and that when we properly associate that with some of our brands that those brands will be enhanced by the association. So I've thought a lot about what you're talking about there. And so our managers and it's something that we intend to capitalize on in the future. It's rather interesting. I mean, if you look at the companies that do business with people where there's no face-to-face interaction either with the company itself or some intermediary like a retailer or anything of the sort, I mean, you've got Dell Computer. Now you have Amazon.com, but Geico is doing business with. Now 3.7 million policyholders in middle to for the years out. It'll be close to 4.5 million and probably 4 billion eight or so of business with people that have never met anyone from Geico. They've talked to someone on the phone. But we are one of the largest companies in the United States in terms of doing business on a direct consumer basis. With people who on average are paying us $1,200 a year or thereabouts for a promise. So we have a connection that people that talk about the Amazon's of the world where people are buying X dollars worth of books where we have a much more direct connection with people who tend to renew with this year after year. That is based on trust. I mean, it's not based on the neighbor next door who they can go to if they have a problem. That's based on the fact they trust this company that's in back in the district of Columbia, Washington to perform in the future. And that's a huge asset. And it's growing daily. I mean, we are adding policyholders every day who are signing up with us who have never met anybody from the company. That already, I mean, it's a very big asset. It will be many times bigger in my view, 10 years from now. The Berkshire Hathaway umbrella that gets involved in one company after another like that that people trust. I mean, we can be in an awful lot of homes over the years. And as more and more business becomes done on an indirect basis or a direct basis with the consumer, the power of that might be we should grow. We should have to be very smart about how we maximize that growth."
"Mr. Buffett, will you groom a young man or woman as your heir apparent? If so, when might you do this? When I say younger, I mean a person 15 to 20 years younger than yourself. Of course I'm not complaining, you're the best in the world. Well, 15 or 20 years younger is a lot easier to do than it used to be.","A large percentage of the world's population is not eligible. We have today the people to take over a butcher. There's no problem about that at all. They have been named in letters that the directors have and they are in place. Exactly who will be the two people? Well of course, or it could be one person. It will depend on one Charlie and I are out of the picture. If we've written the letter 10 years ago, it might have been different than today. It might be different 15 years from now. Our death or incapacity, the timing of it will determine exactly who will be the current person in that letter. We have those people in place. They don't need to be groomed from this point forward. They exist. They'd be ready to run a butcher tomorrow morning and I think you'd be quite pleased with the job they did and that's why I don't worry about having, I've got 99 and 3.4% of my net worth in birkshire. I don't want any of it sold. If I knew I was going to die next week, I would not want it sold in the coming week and I don't want it sold after. I feel very comfortable with the businesses and the managers and the successor top management that we have at birkshire. I just don't want them to take over too early. Charlie? I actually think that the prospects for continuity of corporate culture at the extent we have one at birkshire is higher than prospects for continuity of corporate culture at most other large public companies. I don't see birkshire changing its way of operating even if we're on order to expire tonight. I think that the capital, the fresh cash would be allocated less well. But as I've said at past, shareholder meetings, well that's too damn bad. That's why we don't have a public relations department. Anyway, I don't think the job would be held on. I just don't think it would be done quite as well as Warren does it."
"I want to thank you for the annual reports. They help a lot in helping us make business decisions and life decisions. My question is, many people come here. Many people come here to listen to you and to copy and understand your investment philosophy. But why don't more people, in your opinion, try to copy your investment vehicle, a corporation that pays no dividends?","Well, I don't really think there are other things that are probably better than a copy about Berkshire, but they don't get copied either. It was always interesting to me how few people. Everybody read grams and they didn't really disagree with them. They just didn't like following them because it didn't promise enough in a sense. People really wanted something very quickly. In terms of not paying dividends, we don't pay dividends because we think we can turn every dollar we retain into more than a dollar of market value. The only reason for us to keep your money is if it becomes worth more by us keeping it than it would be worth if we gave it to you. If we can create more than a dollar of market value for every dollar we keep, you're better off whether you want to take that dollar out by selling a little piece of your stock or whether you continue to leave it in. That's the test. If we come to the conclusion that we can't do that and we could come to the conclusion at some time, then we should distribute it to you. The interesting thing is we're in certain businesses, for example, C's candy being one. We don't have a way to intelligently use all of the money that C's generates within the C's candy company. C's were a standalone company. It would pay very large dividends. Not because it had some dividend policy. It would be simply because we wouldn't have a way of using, in this case, $30 million a year intelligently in expanding that business. Buffalo News is the same way. We don't have a way of using money within that specific business intelligently to use the money that it generates. We hope that in the overall, for sure, half-a-way scheme of things, that we can intelligently use the money that the company's in aggregate generate for us. We think so far we have, and we think the prospects are reasonably good that we can continue to do that. Dividend policy should really be determined by that criteria, also bearing in mind the possibilities of repurchase of stock, too, but they should be determined by whether a dollar left in the business is worth more than to the shareholder than a dollar paid out. In some place like Coca-Cola, if Coca-Cola had paid no dividends and simply repurchase shares and develop the modeling system and done the things that they have, the shareholders probably would have been even better off. They've been sensationally well-off as it is, but they probably wouldn't have even better off than they had been with the dividend policy they have had. That's Gillette and Disney, and the companies of that sort that have got these terrific opportunities to use capital within the business or to repurchase shares of a company that simply can't be replaced. That usually is the best use of capital, it's probably better than dividends. We have written some about that, Martin, but people usually keep doing what they've been doing. It's hard to change, Charlie. Well, it's interesting that you take that simple standard. You should retain money if you can make it worth more than it is by retaining it. That is not the standard thing that's taught in the corporate finance departments of our major universities. Why do we have this simple idea and they have another one? Time after time we find that. I've tried to understand why they think the way they do, and I have great difficulty with it. I've just included that they're wrong. But that doesn't enough. There has to be a reason why so many smart people are that wrong. That's a story for another day, but there are things gravely wrong with American education that I hope that Berkshire Hathaway is slowly helping to fix. Can you imagine if the pick any one of you here, let's say the two of us were in a business together, you know, earning $100,000 a year. How would we decide whether to leave the $100,000 each year? And we'd be exactly what we've talked about here. We thought the $100,000 would translate into a present value of more than $100,000 by some action we'd leave it in, but didn't we take it out? And it doesn't seem to register generally. And incidenting in our own case, we'll probably go too long before we come to the conclusion that we're not really using it that effectively, because there'll be a certain denial we'll go through.
