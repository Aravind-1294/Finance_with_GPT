I'd say averaged out I Would expect that the return per dollar per year in managed futures funds would be somewhere between Lousey and negative And I would agree with that. Yeah Yeah Usually those are sales tools. I mean people find out something that will sell and it can be you know It can be bond funds at some point it can be in the but when they find something to sell it'll it'll get sold to the public that will be it will sell till it stops selling and That means lots of money comes in and lots of competition for a limited number of opportunities and I Think it's I think it's a mistake to get sold something on the on the basis that here is a great area of opportunity Opportunity areas don't make opportunities brains make opportunities\",\n",
              " \"That's too soft for me, I think Warren should think about it. Well, I would say that at any given point in history, including one's stocks were their cheapest, you could find an equally impressive number of negative factors. I mean, you could have sat down in 1974 when stocks were screaming bargains, and you could have written down all kinds of things that would have caused you to say the future is just going to be terrible. And similarly, at the top, or anytime you can write down a large list of things that would be quite on the bully side, we really don't pay any attention to that sort of thing. I mean, we have, you might say that our underlying premise, and I think it's a pretty sound underlying premise, is that this country will do very well, and in particularity, it will do well for business. Business has done very well. The Dow went from 66 to 10,000 plus in the hundred years of the 20th century, and we had two world wars and nuclear bombs and flu epidemics, and you name it, Cold War. There's always problems in the future. There are always opportunities in the future, and in this country, the opportunities have won out over the problems over time. And I think they will continue to do so, absent weapons of master's destruction, which is another question, and business won't make much difference if anything really drastically happens along that line. So, we don't, I don't, I can't remember many discussions Charlie that I've had ever going back to 1959, where we would have come to the conclusion at the end of them that we would have passed on a great business opportunity, a business to buy because of external conditions, and we thought it was mediocre, simply because we thought the world was going to be wonderful. It won't be the American economy, in my view, that doesn't invest over a five or ten or twenty year period. It will be the investors themselves. If you look at the record of the 20th century, you'd say, how could anybody have missed, you know, and owning equities during that time, and yet, you know, we had, we had all kinds of people wiped out, you know, in the 29th, 32th period, we had all kinds of things that were bad, but if you would just own stocks right straight through, didn't leverage them, you know, you would, you know, you'd have gotten a perfectly decent return. So, we're, we're unaffected in essence by the, by the variables you mentioned, just show us a good business tomorrow and we'll jump at the hook, Charlie. Yeah, I think, but it's also true that both of us have said it various times over the last three years that we wouldn't be at all surprised if professionally invested money in America. I had a pretty modest result over a fairly extended period of the future compared to the very dramatic way, high returns that it had achieved up to about three years ago. And so far, that's been proved out to be pretty much right. Yeah. Certain stretches are easier than other stretches. Yeah, our expectations were, were more modest than most people, so two years ago, we didn't say the world was coming to the end or anything, we just said that people had gone crazy in certain sectors and that, and that anybody that thought that, that you could, you know, sit at home and day trade and make double digit returns over time or do anything with it, you were entitled to that, you know, by just sticking a little money in your 401k or something, was really living in a fool's paradise. But that was never accompanied by any predictions of disaster for the American economy as a whole or from American businesses. It's, people get crazy notions from time to time in financial markets and we've come in on this earlier but they just believe things that there's, it's hard to understand how they can believe. Now, since I'm a student, they get sold that by other people. But American business really is, is never let investors down or to a group, but investors have done themselves in quite frequently.\",\n",

              " \"There's a future growth in what, John? Well, I have difficulty understanding that question fully. He's talking about how do we combine our estimates of future growth with our passion for having a margin of safety. Surely you can handle that. Well, I certainly handle as well as you can. Every time you lateral is above to me, you know, he calls those audibles. I think you take all of the variables and calculate them reasonably conservatively, but you don't try and put too much windage in at every level. And then when you get all through, you apply the margin of safety. So I would say, don't focus too much on taking it on each variable in terms of the discount rate and the growth rate and so on. But try to be as realistic as you can on those numbers, but with any errors being on the conservative side. And then when you get all through, you apply the margin of safety. Ben Graham had a very simple formula he used for just the most obvious situations, which was to take working capital, networking capital and try and buy it a third off working capital. All that work for him, but that that method sort of ran out of steam when the sub working capital stock disappeared. But it's the same thing we do in insurance. I mean, if we're trying to figure out what we should charge for, we'll just say the chances of a 6.0 earthquake in California. Well, we know that in the last century, I think if there have been 26 or so, 6.0 or greater quakes in California. And let's forget about whether they occur in remote areas, let's just say we were writing a policy to pay off on a 6.0 or greater quake in California, regardless of whether it occurred in a desert and didn't know damage or any. Well, we would look at the history and we'd say, well, there have been 26 in the last century and we would probably assume a little higher number in the next century. That'd just be our nature. But we wouldn't assume 50. If we didn't, we wouldn't run any business. So we wouldn't, we might assume a little higher. I would, if I'm just pricing it myself, I'd probably say, well, I'll assume there are going to be 30, maybe 32 or something like that. Then when I get all through, I want to, I want to put a premium on it that now puts in a margin of safety. And I was at the, if I figured the proper rate for 32 is a million dollars, I would probably want to charge something more than a million dollars to build in that margin of safety. But I don't want to, I don't want to hit it. I want to be conservative at all the levels and then I want to have that significant margin of safety at the end. And I guess that is, I understand the question that's, that'd be my answer, Charlie, you want to get that? Yeah, that, both deep simplicity that I recommended to you says that you can predict out of those 26 earthquakes, how the size will be likely to be allocated. In other words, there's a standard power law that will tell you the likelihood of earthquakes of varying sizes. And of course, the big earthquakes are way less likely than the small ones. So you count them half and you know the applicable power law and you guess as to how much damage is going to, it's not that difficult. But if somebody says they really want to protect against a nine point oh or something like that and then you know, is it one and is it one in 300 years, is it one in a thousand years? You know, way you get really off the data points. But that is not what you're looking at in investments. You don't want to look at the things that are that, you don't want to come up with companies where you make the assumptions that they get that extreme. And you don't have to, that's the beauty about investments. You only have to look at the ones that you feel capable of evaluating and you skip all the rest.\",\n",
              " \"ll answer the second question. First, very easy. I read a lot. And I talk on the telephone and I say, we have no meetings. We have no committees. We have no slide presentations. We have nothing. I mean, so I read a lot. I read annual reports. I read business publications. I could do it in way less time, but I enjoy doing it so I make it last. I mean, like some other activities in life. So it's the most boring job to anybody watching it, but I'm in love with it. So I like doing that. And I don't like talking about it a lot. I just like to kind of keep up with what's going on. Like I say, by this point in life, I could filter out so much of that. I just don't need to do that much of it. But I kind of enjoy just seeing what's going on bicariously through doing a lot of reading. And I spend some time on the phone. And I'm on the computer a lot playing bridge. And I get to do what I like all the time. We'll let Charlie describe what he does, which is even more bizarre. And then we'll talk about compensation adoption. Well, there's a little more foolishness in my life than ours. And including being chairman of a large hospital, I'm not suggesting that hospitals are foolish. I'm just suggesting that it takes a certain core of mind to be willing to be the chairman of a hospital. And so my life is even more, it's less rational than warrants. War on lives one of the most rational lives I've ever seen. And it's almost unbelievable.\"]"
